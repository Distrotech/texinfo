Generally speaking, that means:\r\n- the contents of all input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).\r\n- a statement of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.\r\n- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).\r\n- hardware and operating system information (uname -a).\r\n- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).\r\n- anything else that you think could be helpful.\r\n\r\nPatches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and\r\ninclude ChangeLog entries.\r\n\r\nSee README-hacking for information on the Texinfo development\r\nenvironment -- any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a\r\nprogrammer and wish to contribute, this should get you started.  If\r\nyou're not a programmer, you can still make significant contributions by\r\nwriting test cases, checking the documentation against the\r\nimplementation, etc.\r\n\r\nThis distribution includes the following files, among others:\r\n    README                 This file.\r\n    README-hacking         Texinfo developer information.\r\n\r\n    INSTALL                Texinfo-specific installation notes.\r\n    NEWS                   Summary of new features by release.\r\n\r\nTexinfo documentation files (in ./doc):\r\n    texinfo.txi            Describes the Texinfo language and many\r\n                           of the associated tools.
