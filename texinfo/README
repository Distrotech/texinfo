Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of all input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a statement of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware and operating system information (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think could be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

See README-hacking for information on the Texinfo development
environment -- any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a
programmer and wish to contribute, this should get you started.  If
you're not a programmer, you can still make significant contributions by
writing test cases, checking the documentation against the
implementation, etc.

This distribution includes the following files, among others:
    README                 This file.
    README-hacking         Texinfo developer information.

    INSTALL                Texinfo-specific installation notes.
    NEWS                   Summary of new features by release.
    INTRODUCTION           Brief introduction to the system, and
                           how to create readable files from the
                           Texinfo source files in this distribution.

Texinfo documentation files (in ./doc):
    texinfo.txi            Describes the Texinfo language and many
                           of the associated tools.  It tells how to use
                           Texinfo to write documentation, how to use
                           Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, TeX, makeinfo, and
                           the Emacs Lisp Texinfo formatting commands.

    info.texi              This manual tells you how to read manuals
                           in Info.  This document also comes as part of
                           GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs, you can
                           format this Texinfo source file with makeinfo
                           or TeX and then read the resulting Info file
                           with the standalone Info reader that is part
                           of this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi         This manual tells you how to use
                           the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                           included in this distribution as C
                           source (./info).

Printing-related files:
    doc/texinfo.tex        This implements Texinfo in TeX, to typeset a
                           Texinfo file into a DVI or PDF file.

    util/texindex.c        This file contains the source for
                           the `texindex' program that generates
                           sorted indices used by TeX when
                           typesetting a file for printing.

    util/texi2dvi          This is a shell script for producing an
                           indexed DVI file using TeX and texindex.
    
    util/texi2pdf          Generate PDF, otherwise like texi2dvi.

Source directories: 
  djgpp/                   Support for compiling under DJGPP.

  po                       Strings of the programs.
  po_document              Strings in generated Texinfo documents.

Installation support:
  Makefile.am              Read by Automake to create a Makefile.in.

                             created by Automake.
  configure.ac		   Read by Autoconf to create `configure'.
