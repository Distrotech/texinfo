install-info updates the top-level dir file in the Info tree.
(It does not actually install .info files into the Info directory, oddly
enough.)

Debian has a completely different implementation (in Perl) of
install-info.  This has been a point of great confusion.  The present C
install-info is suitable as a replacement for Debian's program, as far
as we know, but it is up to them as to when or if that happens.
