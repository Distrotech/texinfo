The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  ./bootstrap
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
