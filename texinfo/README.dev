This README.dev file describes the development environment.

The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, with the files being checked in to CVS.  If you
want to update from the current gnulib, then do a cvs checkout of
gnulib, and run
  gnulib-tool --update
in the top-level directory.

For the record, the first time invocation was
  gnulib-tool --import --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --source-base=gnulib/lib getopt
The currently-used gnulib modules and other gnulib information are
recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  Given a source checkout of
gnulib, you can update the files with gnulib-tool --import.  (The goal
is to always have the latest versions of gnulib files in Texinfo CVS.)

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
