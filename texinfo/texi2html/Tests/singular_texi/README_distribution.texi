@majorheading README file for the @sc{Singular} distribution

@sc{Singular} is a Computer Algebra system for polynomial computations
with special emphasize on the needs of commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, singularity theory and polynomial system solving. For a more
detailed overview of
@sc{Singular}, see

@sc{Singular} version 2 is generally much faster than any previous version of
@sc{Singular}, due to a rewriting of major parts of
the @sc{Singular} kernel (e.g., the kernel has a new memory manager and a
new polynomial arithmetic), and due to new and
better implemented algorithms (e.g., for computing resolutions
and determinants).

Besides these internal changes, @sc{Singular} version 2 offers many new features
and functionalities (which were already partly included in the 1-3 series).
E.g., a native Windows distribution, an Emacs user interface,
a new help system, 16 new libraries, etc.
