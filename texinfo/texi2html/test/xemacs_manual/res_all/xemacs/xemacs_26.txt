23 Abbrevs
**********

  An abbrev is a word which expands into some
different text.  Abbrevs are defined by the user to expand in specific
ways.  For example, you might define `foo' as an abbrev expanding to
`find outer otter'.  With this abbrev defined, you would be able to
get `find outer otter ' into the buffer by typing f o o <SPC>.

  Abbrevs expand only when Abbrev mode (a minor mode) is enabled.
Disabling Abbrev mode does not cause abbrev definitions to be discarded,
but they do not expand until Abbrev mode is enabled again.  The command
M-x abbrev-mode toggles Abbrev mode; with a numeric argument, it
turns Abbrev mode on if the argument is positive, off otherwise.
See Minor Modes.  abbrev-mode is also a variable; Abbrev mode is
on when the variable is non-nil.  The variable abbrev-mode
automatically becomes local to the current buffer when it is set.

  Abbrev definitions can be mode-specific--active only in one major
mode.  Abbrevs can also have global definitions that are active in
all major modes.  The same abbrev can have a global definition and various
mode-specific definitions for different major modes.  A mode-specific
definition for the current major mode overrides a global definition.

 You can define Abbrevs interactively during an editing session.  You
can also save lists of abbrev definitions in files and reload them in later
sessions.  Some users keep extensive lists of abbrevs that they load in
every session.

  A second kind of abbreviation facility is called the dynamic
expansion.  Dynamic abbrev expansion happens only when you give an
explicit command and the result of the expansion depends only on the
current contents of the buffer.  See Dynamic Abbrevs.

23.1 Defining Abbrevs
=====================

C-x a g
Define an abbrev to expand into some text before point
(add-global-abbrev).
C-x a l
Similar, but define an abbrev available only in the current major mode
(add-mode-abbrev).
C-x a i g
Define a word in the buffer as an abbrev (inverse-add-global-abbrev).
C-x a i l
Define a word in the buffer as a mode-specific abbrev
(inverse-add-mode-abbrev).
M-x kill-all-abbrevs
After this command, no abbrev definitions remain in effect.

  The usual way to define an abbrev is to enter the text you want the
abbrev to expand to, position point after it, and type C-x a g
(add-global-abbrev).  This reads the abbrev itself using the
minibuffer, and then defines it as an abbrev for one or more words
before point.  Use a numeric argument to say how many words before point
should be taken as the expansion.  For example, to define the abbrev
`foo' as in the example above, insert the text `find outer
otter', then type 
C-u 3 C-x a g f o o <RET>.

  An argument of zero to C-x a g means to use the contents of the
region as the expansion of the abbrev being defined.

  The command C-x a l (add-mode-abbrev) is similar, but
defines a mode-specific abbrev.  Mode-specific abbrevs are active only in a
particular major mode.  C-x a l defines an abbrev for the major mode
in effect at the time C-x a l is typed.  The arguments work the
same way they do for C-x a g.

  If the text of an abbrev you want is already in the buffer instead of
the expansion, use command C-x a i g (inverse-add-global-abbrev)
instead of C-x a g, or use C-x a i l
(inverse-add-mode-abbrev) instead of C-x a l.  These commands
are called "inverse" because they invert the meaning of the argument
found in the buffer and the argument read using the minibuffer.

  To change the definition of an abbrev, just add the new definition.  You
will be asked to confirm if the abbrev has a prior definition.  To remove
an abbrev definition, give a negative argument to C-x a g or C-x
a l.  You must choose the command to specify whether to kill a global
definition or a mode-specific definition for the current mode, since those
two definitions are independent for one abbrev.

  M-x kill-all-abbrevs removes all existing abbrev definitions.

23.2 Controlling Abbrev Expansion
=================================

  An abbrev expands whenever it is in a buffer just before point and you
type a self-inserting punctuation character (<SPC>, comma,
etc.).  Most often an abbrev is used by inserting the abbrev followed
by punctuation.

  Abbrev expansion preserves case; thus, `foo' expands into `find
outer otter', `Foo' into `Find outer otter', and `FOO' into
`FIND OUTER OTTER' or `Find Outer Otter' according to the
variable abbrev-all-caps (a non-nil value chooses the first
of the two expansions).

   Two commands are available to control abbrev expansion:

M-'
Separate a prefix from a following abbrev to be expanded
(abbrev-prefix-mark).
C-x a e
Expand the abbrev before point (expand-abbrev).
This is effective even when Abbrev mode is not enabled.
M-x unexpand-abbrev
Undo last abbrev expansion.
M-x expand-region-abbrevs
Expand some or all abbrevs found in the region.

  You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached.  For example,
if `cnst' expands into `construction', you may want to use it
to enter `reconstruction'.  It does not work to type recnst,
because that is not necessarily a defined abbrev.  Instead, you can use
the command M-' (abbrev-prefix-mark) between the prefix
`re' and the abbrev `cnst'.  First, insert `re'.  Then
type M-'; this inserts a minus sign in the buffer to indicate that
it has done its work.  Then insert the abbrev `cnst'.  The buffer
now contains `re-cnst'.  Now insert a punctuation character to
expand the abbrev `cnst' into `construction'.  The minus sign
is deleted at this point by M-'.  The resulting text is the
desired `reconstruction'.

  If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than
its expansion, insert the following punctuation with C-q.  Thus,
foo C-q - leaves `foo-' in the buffer.

  If you expand an abbrev by mistake, you can undo the expansion (replace
the expansion by the original abbrev text) with M-x unexpand-abbrev.
You can also use C-_ (undo) to undo the expansion; but that
will first undo the insertion of the punctuation character.

  M-x expand-region-abbrevs searches through the region for defined
abbrevs, and  offers to replace each one it finds with its expansion.
This command is useful if you have typed text using abbrevs but forgot
to turn on Abbrev mode first.  It may also be useful together with a
special set of abbrev definitions for making several global replacements at
once.  The command is effective even if Abbrev mode is not enabled.

23.3 Examining and Editing Abbrevs
==================================

M-x list-abbrevs
Print a list of all abbrev definitions.
M-x edit-abbrevs
Edit a list of abbrevs; you can add, alter, or remove definitions.

  The output from M-x list-abbrevs looks like this:

(lisp-mode-abbrev-table)
"dk"           0    "define-key"
(global-abbrev-table)
"dfn"          0    "definition"

(Some blank lines of no semantic significance, and some other abbrev
tables, have been omitted.)

  A line containing a name in parentheses is the header for abbrevs in a
particular abbrev table; global-abbrev-table contains all the global
abbrevs, and the other abbrev tables that are named after major modes
contain the mode-specific abbrevs.

  Within each abbrev table, each non-blank line defines one abbrev.  The
word at the beginning is the abbrev.  The number that appears is the number
of times the abbrev has been expanded.  Emacs keeps track of this to help
you see which abbrevs you actually use, in case you want to eliminate
those that you don't use often.  The string at the end of the line is the
expansion.

  M-x edit-abbrevs allows you to add, change or kill abbrev
definitions by editing a list of them in an Emacs buffer.  The list has
the format described above.  The buffer of abbrevs is called
`*Abbrevs*', and is in Edit-Abbrevs mode.  This mode redefines the
key C-c C-c to install the abbrev definitions as specified in the
buffer.  The  edit-abbrevs-redefine command does this.
Any abbrevs not described in the buffer are eliminated when this is
done.

  edit-abbrevs is actually the same as list-abbrevs, except
that it selects the buffer `*Abbrevs*' whereas list-abbrevs
merely displays it in another window.

23.4 Saving Abbrevs
===================

  These commands allow you to keep abbrev definitions between editing
sessions.

M-x write-abbrev-file
Write a file describing all defined abbrevs.
M-x read-abbrev-file
Read such an abbrev file and define abbrevs as specified there.
M-x quietly-read-abbrev-file
Similar, but do not display a message about what is going on.
M-x define-abbrevs
Define abbrevs from buffer.
M-x insert-abbrevs
Insert all abbrevs and their expansions into the buffer.

  Use M-x write-abbrev-file to save abbrev definitions for use in
a later session.  The command reads a file name using the minibuffer and
writes a description of all current abbrev definitions into the
specified file.  The text stored in the file looks like the output of
M-x list-abbrevs.


  M-x read-abbrev-file prompts for a file name using the
minibuffer and reads the specified file, defining abbrevs according to
its contents.  M-x quietly-read-abbrev-file is the same but does
not display a message in the echo area; it is actually useful primarily
in the init file.  See Init File. If you give an empty argument to
either of these functions, the file name Emacs uses is the value of the
variable abbrev-file-name, which is by default
"~/.abbrev_defs".

  Emacs offers to save abbrevs automatically if you have changed any of
them, whenever it offers to save all files (for C-x s or C-x
C-c).  Set the variable save-abbrevs to nil to inhibit
this feature.

  The commands M-x insert-abbrevs and M-x define-abbrevs are
similar to the previous commands but work on text in an Emacs buffer.
M-x insert-abbrevs inserts text into the current buffer before point,
describing all current abbrev definitions; M-x define-abbrevs parses
the entire current buffer and defines abbrevs accordingly.

23.5 Dynamic Abbrev Expansion
=============================

  The abbrev facility described above operates automatically as you insert
text, but all abbrevs must be defined explicitly.  By contrast,
dynamic abbrevs allow the meanings of abbrevs to be determined
automatically from the contents of the buffer, but dynamic abbrev expansion
happens only when you request it explicitly.

M-/
Expand the word in the buffer before point as a dynamic abbrev,
by searching in the buffer for words starting with that abbreviation
(dabbrev-expand).

  For example, if the buffer contains `does this follow ' and you type
f o M-/, the effect is to insert `follow' because that is the
last word in the buffer that starts with `fo'.  A numeric argument to
M-/ says to take the second, third, etc. distinct expansion found
looking backward from point.  Repeating M-/ searches for an
alternative expansion by looking farther back.  After the entire buffer
before point has been considered, the buffer after point is searched.

  Dynamic abbrev expansion is completely independent of Abbrev mode; the
expansion of a word with M-/ is completely independent of whether it
has a definition as an ordinary abbrev.
