24 Editing Pictures
*******************

  If you want to create a picture made out of text characters (for example,
a picture of the division of a register into fields, as a comment in a
program), use the command edit-picture to enter Picture mode.

  In Picture mode, editing is based on the quarter-plane model of
text.  In this model, the text characters lie studded on an area that
stretches infinitely far to the right and downward.  The concept of the end
of a line does not exist in this model; the most you can say is where the
last non-blank character on the line is found.

  Of course, Emacs really always considers text as a sequence of
characters, and lines really do have ends.  But in Picture mode most
frequently-used keys are rebound to commands that simulate the
quarter-plane model of text.  They do this by inserting spaces or by
converting tabs to spaces.

  Most of the basic editing commands of Emacs are redefined by Picture mode
to do essentially the same thing but in a quarter-plane way.  In addition,
Picture mode defines various keys starting with the C-c prefix to
run special picture editing commands.

  One of these keys, C-c C-c, is pretty important.  Often a picture
is part of a larger file that is usually edited in some other major mode.
M-x edit-picture records the name of the previous major mode. 
You can then use the C-c C-c command (picture-mode-exit) to
restore that mode.  C-c C-c also deletes spaces from the ends of
lines, unless you give it a numeric argument.

  The commands used in Picture mode all work in other modes (provided the
`picture' library is loaded), but are only  bound to keys in
Picture mode.  Note that the descriptions below talk of moving "one
column" and so on, but all the picture mode commands handle numeric
arguments as their normal equivalents do.

  Turning on Picture mode calls the value of the variable
picture-mode-hook as a function, with no arguments, if that value
exists and is non-nil.

24.1 Basic Editing in Picture Mode
==================================

  Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but do
it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, C-f is rebound to run
picture-forward-column, which moves point one column to
the right, by inserting a space if necessary, so that the actual end of the
line makes no difference.  C-b is rebound to run
picture-backward-column, which always moves point left one column,
converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  C-n and C-p
are rebound to run picture-move-down and picture-move-up,
which can either insert spaces or convert tabs as necessary to make sure
that point stays in exactly the same column.  C-e runs
picture-end-of-line, which moves to after the last non-blank
character on the line.  There was no need to change C-a, as the choice
of screen model does not affect beginnings of lines.

  Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model through
the use of Overwrite mode (see Minor Modes).  Self-inserting characters
replace existing text, column by column, rather than pushing existing text
to the right.  <RET> runs picture-newline, which just moves to
the beginning of the following line so that new text will replace that
line.

  Text is erased instead of deleted and killed.  <DEL>
(picture-backward-clear-column) replaces the preceding character
with a space rather than removing it.  C-d
(picture-clear-column) does the same in a forward direction.
C-k (picture-clear-line) really kills the contents of lines,
but never removes the newlines from a buffer.

  To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  C-o
(picture-open-line) creates a blank line, but does so after
the current line; it never splits a line.  C-M-o, split-line,
makes sense in Picture mode, so it remains unchanged.  <LFD>
(picture-duplicate-line) inserts another line
with the same contents below the current line.

 
  To actually delete parts of the picture, use C-w, or with
C-c C-d (which is defined as delete-char, as C-d is
in other modes), or with one of the picture rectangle commands
(see Rectangles in Picture).

24.2 Controlling Motion After Insert
====================================

  Since "self-inserting" characters just overwrite and move point in
Picture mode, there is no essential restriction on how point should be
moved.  Normally point moves right, but you can specify any of the eight
orthogonal or diagonal directions for motion after a "self-inserting"
character.  This is useful for drawing lines in the buffer.

C-c <
Move left after insertion (picture-movement-left).
C-c >
Move right after insertion (picture-movement-right).
C-c ^
Move up after insertion (picture-movement-up).
C-c .
Move down after insertion (picture-movement-down).
C-c `
Move up and left ("northwest") after insertion 
(picture-movement-nw).
C-c '
Move up and right ("northeast") after insertion 

(picture-movement-ne).
C-c /
Move down and left ("southwest") after insertion

(picture-movement-sw).
C-c \
Move down and right ("southeast") after insertion

(picture-movement-se).

  Two motion commands move based on the current Picture insertion
direction.  The command C-c C-f (picture-motion) moves in the
same direction as motion after "insertion" currently does, while C-c
C-b (picture-motion-reverse) moves in the opposite direction.

24.3 Picture Mode Tabs
======================
 
  Two kinds of tab-like action are provided in Picture mode.
Context-based tabbing is done with M-<TAB>
(picture-tab-search).  With no argument, it moves to a point
underneath the next "interesting" character that follows whitespace in
the previous non-blank line.  "Next" here means "appearing at a
horizontal position greater than the one point starts out at".  With an
argument, as in C-u M-<TAB>, the command moves to the next such
interesting character in the current line.  M-<TAB> does not
change the text; it only moves point.  "Interesting" characters are
defined by the variable picture-tab-chars, which contains a string
of characters considered interesting.  Its default value is
"!-~".

  <TAB> itself runs picture-tab, which operates based on the
current tab stop settings; it is the Picture mode equivalent of
tab-to-tab-stop.  Without arguments it just moves point, but with
a numeric argument it clears the text that it moves over.

  The context-based and tab-stop-based forms of tabbing are brought
together by the command C-c <TAB> (picture-set-tab-stops.)
This command sets the tab stops to the positions which M-<TAB>
would consider significant in the current line.  If you use this command
with <TAB>, you can get the effect of context-based tabbing.  But
M-<TAB> is more convenient in the cases where it is sufficient.

24.4 Picture Mode Rectangle Commands
====================================

  Picture mode defines commands for working on rectangular pieces of the
text in ways that fit with the quarter-plane model.  The standard rectangle
commands may also be useful (see Rectangles).

C-c C-k
Clear out the region-rectangle (picture-clear-rectangle).  With
argument, kill it.
C-c C-w r
Similar but save rectangle contents in register r first
(picture-clear-rectangle-to-register).
C-c C-y
Copy last killed rectangle into the buffer by overwriting, with upper
left corner at point (picture-yank-rectangle).  With argument,
insert instead.
C-c C-x r
Similar, but use the rectangle in register r

(picture-yank-rectangle-from-register).

  The picture rectangle commands C-c C-k
(picture-clear-rectangle) and C-c C-w
(picture-clear-rectangle-to-register) differ from the standard
rectangle commands in that they normally clear the rectangle instead of
deleting it; this is analogous with the way C-d is changed in Picture
mode.

  However, deletion of rectangles can be useful in Picture mode, so these
commands delete the rectangle if given a numeric argument.

  The Picture mode commands for yanking rectangles differ from the standard
ones in overwriting instead of inserting.  This is the same way that
Picture mode insertion of other text is different from other modes.
C-c C-y (picture-yank-rectangle) inserts (by overwriting) the
rectangle that was most recently killed, while C-c C-x
(picture-yank-rectangle-from-register) does for the
rectangle found in a specified register.

Since most region commands in Picture mode operate on rectangles, when you
select a region of text with the mouse in Picture mode, it is highlighted
as a rectangle.
