   Ignore is the same than @html.

   Now ifnothtml on same line  text following ifnothtml

   text following an empty line text before end ifnothtml @end ifnothtml
doesn't need to begin the line, and there can be more than one space
between @end and ifnothtml, but nothing more on the line.

   Text on the line before ifnothtml with text following,  text
following ifnothtml, Text on the line following ifnothtml.

   Text on the line before ifnothtml without text following, some text
on a line between ifnothtml and end  ifnothtml, Text on the line

In the node with braces

   A footnote with an empty line within.  (1)

   Now a ref with a footnote within, there aren't 2 paragraphes in the
footnote in that case in info. tex doesn't like the paragraph break in
the ref

   Some @verbatim, @verb and @ignore within an xref, very hard for TeX:
