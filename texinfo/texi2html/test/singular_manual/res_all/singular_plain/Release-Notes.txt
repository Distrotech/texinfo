E.1 News and changes
====================


NEWS in SINGULAR 2-0-4
**********************



The current version 2-0-4 is an update to the 
release series version 2-0. 

Changes with respect to version 2-0-3:

Factorizing algorithms revisited
================================
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (by Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factoring code in libfac/factory
does now also work over algebraic extension fields.

Help system is configurable via LIB/help.cnf
============================================
The help browsers of Singular can be configured via the file
LIB/help.cnf, also the addition of new help browsers is possible.

Extensions of the ring concept
==============================

new coefficient domains: arbitrary long real and complex numbers
no restriction on number of parameters
degree bound on exponent values (maximum is now 2^31, standard 2^15)
non-positives weights get a better handling (converts wp/Wp to ws/Ws)
handle blocks of mixed orders correctly
maximal prime characteristic is now 2147483629 instead of 32003

Changes in SINGULAR libraries
=============================
The documentation of libraries was generally improved.
equising_lib
procedures esStratum, isEquising now also for reducible polynomials

new procedures: tau_es (codim of mu-const stratum in semi-universal def. base);
esIdeal ((Wahl's) equisingularity ideal)
gaussman_lib
added bernstein: roots of the Bernstein polynomial of t
hnoether_lib
HNdevelop, reddevelop, essdevelop are obsolete, replaced by hnexpansion

multsequence is "repaired" (since branches computed by hnexpansion
et al) are now ordered according to the needs of multsequence.

newtonpoly needs no longer that ordering of the basering is ls

new procedures: is_NND      test if f is Newton non-degenerate
homolog_lib
new procedures: depth, fitting, flatteningStrat, isCM, isFlat, isLocallyFree,
isReg, KoszulHomology, tensorMod, Tor
matrix_lib
in proc tensor(A,B):  check if ncols(A)==0
normal_lib
new procedure: deltaLoc(f,S);      (sum of) delta invariant(s) at conjugated
singular points

proc genus makes now use of is_NND of hnoether.lib
primdec_lib
optimizations again
solve_lib
procedure laguerre_solve ignores no longer the 2nd parameter (precision of 
internal computation)

 new procedure simplexOut:     prints solution of simplex in nice format

Internal Changes
================
normal form computation uses
Bucket representation of polynomials.
factorization
revisited, missing cases implemented
NTL
NTL is used for univariate factorization
source code
adapted for use with gcc 3.1/3.2, gmp 4.x

gives details on how to finish the installation.




E.3 Unix installation instructions
==================================






To install SINGULAR on a
Unix
platform, you need the following two
archives:
Singular-2-0-4-share.tar.gz
contains architecture independent data like documentation and libraries
(alternatively, you may also download
Singular-2-0-4-share.zip).
Singular-2-0-4-<uname>.tar.gz
contains architecture dependent executables, like the SINGULAR
program.


<uname> is a description of the processor and operating system
for which SINGULAR is compiled (e.g, ix86-Linux). Please contact us if
you can not find an appropriate architecture dependent archive.

You can obtain these (and other) archives from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular>.


To install SINGULAR
===================

Make sure that you have approximately 12MByte of free disk space and follow
these steps.
1. Simply change to the directory in which you wish to install
SINGULAR (usually wherever you install 3rd-party software), for example:
cd /usr/local
or
mkdir install;cd install 
(you do not need root privileges in this case)

SINGULAR specific subdirectories will be created in such a way
that multiple versions and multiple architecture dependent files
of SINGULAR can peaceably coexist under the same /usr/local
tree.

2. Unpack the archives:
gzip -dc <path_to>/Singular-2-0-4-<uname>.tar.gz | tar -pxf -
gzip -dc <path_to>/Singular-2-0-4-share.tar.gz | tar -pxf -

This creates the the directory Singular/2-0-4 with 
 (sub)directories which contain
 <uname> Singular and ESingular executables
 LIB SINGULAR libraries (*.lib files)
 emacs files for the SINGULAR Emacs user interface
 info info files of SINGULAR manual
 html html files of SINGULAR manual
 doc miscellaneous documentation files
 examples SINGULAR examples (*.sing files)

For the executable to work, the directory layout must look pretty much
like this; the executable looks for "sibling" directories at run-time
to figure out where its SINGULAR libraries and on-line
documentation files are. These constraints on the local directory layout
are necessary to avoid having to hard-code pathnames into the
executables, or require that environment variables be set before
running the executable. In particular, you must not move or copy
the SINGULAR executables to another place, but use soft-links
instead.

The following steps are optional:

* Arrange that typing Singular at the shell prompt starts up the
installed SINGULAR executable.

If you have root permission, do:
ln -s `pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/Singular  /usr/local/bin/Singular-2-0-4
ln -s `pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/ESingular  /usr/local/bin/ESingular-2-0-4
ln -s /usr/local/bin/Singular-2-0-4 /usr/local/bin/Singular
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ESingular-2-0-4 /usr/local/bin/ESingular
	
Otherwise, append the directory
`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/ to your $PATH
environment variable. For the csh (or, tcsh) shell do:
set path=(`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname> $path)
For the bash (or, ksh) shell do:
export PATH=`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/:$PATH

You also might want to adjust your personal start-up files
(~/.cshrc for csh, ~/.tcshrc for tcsh, or
~/.profile for bash) accordingly,
so that the $PATH variable is set automatically each time you login.

IMPORTANT: Do never move or copy the file
Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/Singular to another
place, but use soft-links instead.

* If you wish to use any of following features of
SINGULAR, make sure that the respective programs are installed on your system:

 Feature Requires
 running ESingular, or Singular within Emacs Emacs <http://www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs.html> version
20 or higher, or, XEmacs <http://www.xemacs.org> version 20.3 or
higher (ESingular is only included in the Linux distribution,
on other Unix platforms you can download the
Singular emacs lisp files <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/src/> but we give no warranties for specific platforms).
 on-line html help netscape <http://www.netscape.com> browser
 on-line info help info <http://www.texinfo.org>, or
tkinfo <http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/tkinfo/> texinfo browser programs
 TAB completion and history mechanism of ASCII-terminal interface shared readline <ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/gnu/readline/>
library, i.e. /usr/lib/libreadline.so
 visualization of curves and surfaces surf <http://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/AlgebraischeGeometrie/surf/surf.shtml>
version 0.9 or higher (only available for Linux and Solaris).

You may download most of these programs from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils/>.

* Customize the on-line help system:

By default, on-line help is displayed in the html format using
the netscape program.

However, this behavior can be customized in several ways
using the SINGULAR commands system("--browser",<browser>)
and system("--allow-net", 1) (or, by starting up SINGULAR
with the respective command line options).

In particular, creating the file
Singular/2-0-4/LIB/.singularrc and putting the
SINGULAR command
system("--allow-net", 1);
in it, allows the on-line help system to fetch its html pages
from Singular's WWW home site <http://www.singular.uni-kl.de>
in case its local html pages are not found. That is, you may delete your
local html pages, after setting this option.

See also
The online help system, Command line options, and
Startup sequence,
for more details on customizing the on-line help system.

* Add the line
* Singular:(singular.hlp).     A system for polynomial computations
to your system-wide dir file (usually /usr/info/dir or
/usr/local/info/dir and  copy or soft-link the file
Singular/2-0-4/info/singular.hlp
to the directory of your dir file.

This assures that the
SINGULAR manual can be  accessed from stand-alone texinfo
browser programs such as info or Emacs.
(It is not necessary for the use of the help system from within Singular.)

Troubleshooting
===============

* General: SINGULAR can not find its libraries or on-line help
1. Make sure that you have read and/or execute permission the files and
directories of the Singular distribution. If in doubt, cd to the
directory where you unpacked SINGULAR, and do (as root, if
necessary):
chmod -R a+rX Singular

2. Start up SINGULAR, and issue the command system("Singular");.
If this does not return the correct and expanded location of the
SINGULAR executable, then you found a bug in SINGULAR, which we
ask you to report (see below).
3. Check whether the directories containing the libraries and on-line help
files can be found by SINGULAR: If $bindir denotes the
directory where the SINGULAR executable resides, then SINGULAR
looks for library files as follows:

 (0) the current directory

 (1) all dirs of the environment variable SINGULARPATH

 (2) $bindir/LIB

 (3) $bindir/../LIB

 (4) /usr/local/Singular/2-0-4/LIB

 (4) /usr/local/Singular/LIB

 The on-line info files need to be at  $bindir/../info and the
html pages at $bindir/../html.

You can inspect the found library and info/html
directories by starting up SINGULAR with the
--version option, or by issuing the SINGULAR command
system("--version");.

* Under SuSE-Linux, ESINGULAR does not display a prompt:
This is due to the very restrictive access rights of /dev/pty* of
the standard SuSE <http:/www.suse.de> distribution (starting from
version 6.3 on). As root, do one of the following: Either
chmod 666 /dev/pty*
or,
chmod g+s $(which emacs)
chgrp tty $(which emacs)
chmod g+s $(which xemacs)
chgrp tty $(which xemacs)
See also <http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/de/html/ke_devpts-63.html> for
details.

* For HPUX systems:

The /etc/termcap files which are pre-installed on these systems are
broken which leads to messages like
Name collision between 9826 9836
when SINGULAR is started. To fix this, you can get fixed termcap
files from <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils>
by downloading the files termcap-<uname-description> and either
replace your /etc/termcap file by the file found there, or view, and
redo the respective changes by diff'ing the downloaded and the
original file.

* For ix86-Linux systems:

Due to some incompatibilities of shared libraries, the start-up of
SINGULAR might fail with messages like
  Can not find shared library ...
For DEBIAN systems, try to do
ln -s /usr/lib/libncurses.so /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4.

If this fails (and on other systems)
download and install
Singular-2-0-4-ix86-Linux-static.tar.gz.

* For AIX systems:

The default info program of the system is not GNU's texinfo
browser which is used to display the on-line documentation in the
info format. Therefore, the distribution of the AIX executable
already contains the info browser program.
If you remove this program, make sure that the GNU
info program is executed if you call 'info' from your shell.

* For any other troubles:

Please send an email to <mailto:singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
and include the header which is displayed by starting up SINGULAR
with the -v option, and a description of your machine (issue the
command uname -a on your shell) in your report.




E.4 Windows installation instructions
=====================================






For the impatient:
==================
* If you run Windows NT/2K/XP, make sure you are logged in with the
Administrator rights.
* If you have some older version of Singular installed, please uninstall it
before installing Singular-2-0-4. It is recommended to
install the new Singular in the same directory where the previous
version was installed. Thus your existing environment will be used automatically.
* If you have Cygwin or XEmacs installed and they do not belong
of some previous Singular installation,
please read the information below.
* Execute the self-extracting installation archive and
carefully follow the instructions given there. 
Setup will analyze your system, create the corresponding configuration
and give you further tips on the installation process.
* In case of troubles, see the installed files /etc/INSTALL.txt,
/etc/TROUBLESHOOTING.txt or visit
the Singular Forum at <http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum>.


Installation preliminaries
==========================

Running Singular on MS Windows requires that the Cygwin DLL
(dynamically linked library) version 1.3.9 or higher is installed on your
system (see <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/> for details about
Cygwin). We install and configure Cygwin version 1.3.9 automatically, if
the BasicCygwin component is selected (default setting).

To run ESingular (i.e. Singular within its Emacs interface) on
MS Windows requires furthermore that the XEmacs editor is installed on
your system. We install and configure XEmacs version 21.1.13 automatically, if the XEmacs component is selected.


The Singular installation is divided into the following
components (you see them explicitly if you choose the Custom Setup Type
during the installation):
Program Files:
        Singular
Contains the Singular Program, documentation and example files.

All files of this component are installed under the directory
/usr/local/Singular/2-0-4
BasicCygwin
Contains the Cygwin DLL and basic tools/programs (like bash or
info) of the  Cygwin environment.

The Cygwin DLL and programs are installed in the directory
/bin. Miscellaneous documentation and configuration files are
installed into the directory /etc.
XEmacs
Contains the Cygwin port of the XEmacs editor (see
<http://www.xemacs.org> for more about XEmacs) version 21.1.13.

All files of this component are installed under the directory
/usr/local.
ESingular
Contains the ESingular, the most comfortable Singular interface.
Requires XEmacs to run.
        Remark:
All essential DLLs, some programs and symbolic links are installed in the directory
/usr/local/Singular/2-0-4/ix86-Win, which must be present in your PATH system variable.
Help Files:
WinHelp
Contains Singular Manual, converted to Windows help format (.hlp).
We recommend to install it, because it is small in size. Moreover,
we set it as default help browser in all the Singular executables.
HTML Help
Contains the "native" Singular Manual. It's not included by default,
because it is much bigger than WinHelp, though it has better typesetting
of mathematical formulae.

The Typical Setup Type of the Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe contains
BasicCygwin, Singular, 
XEmacs, ESingular, WinHelp and HTML Help 
components. The Compact Setup Type does not contain only the HTML Help component.

Downloading preliminaries
=========================

To install Singular on a PC running Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP, you need
to download one of the following archive files:

Minimal archive: Singular-2-0-4-Compact.exe <Singular-2-0-4-Compact.exe>      (BasicCygwin, Singular, WinHelp components)

Typical archive : Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe <Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe>      (BasicCygwin, Singular, XEmacs, ESingular, WinHelp, HTML Help components)

You can obtain these (and other) archives 
either from the WINDOWS directory on the Singular CD or from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/>.



Installing Singular
===================

The recent Setup program analyzes your system, e.g. it detects
whether Cygwin and XEmacs are present and functional. Then it gives you
hints and/or error messages with instructions during the installation.

If you have Cygwin installed
        If the version of cygwin1.dll is not less than 1.3.9,
        you will be prompted that the BasicCygwin component will not
        be installed. Moreover, the existing Cygwin root directory will be proposed as
        the default installation directory. You can accept it, then
        Singular will be placed into the existing Cygwin environment.
        If you choose another destination, Singular will use Cygwin
        programs anyway. If your Cygwin has incorrect settings (like
        inconsistent mount points among the important ones), Singular
        Setup will correct them. 

      If setup could not detect cygwin, present in the system, you
        can try to break the installation, start it once more, choose the
        "Custom" setup type and unselect the BasicCygwin component.

If you have XEmacs installed
        The Cygwin port of XEmacs version 21.1.13 together 
        with the most
        important packages is included in the distribution. The use of 
        non-Cygwin ports or earlier Cygwin ports has some 
        quirks and does not work 
        properly together with Singular (i.e., running ESingular 
        results in problems). Nevertheless, if you want to test the
        compatibility of ESingular with your own XEmacs, just
        de-select the XEmacs component, but leave ESingular selected.
        If your XEmacs happens to be incompatible with ESingular, you can
        install just the XEmacs component and use in fact two different
        XEmacs programs. 
        The setup program will search for XEmacs and packages 
        in <TARGETDIR>/usr/local/lib (here <TARGETDIR> is the directory which you selected while running setup). If you have Cygwin and the Cygwin port of
        XEmacs, you might have XEmacs installed there. To avoid overwriting your XEmacs files, setup will ask you what to do.


Customizing Singular
====================

The following step(s) are optional:
* To conveniently access all files on your computer, mount the drives of
your disk(s):
1. Open a rxvt terminal (from Start->Programs->Singular 2.0->Tools).
2. For each drive (letter) issue the following command (the drive C:
is used in the example):
mount -f -s -t C: /C
After mounting the drive(s) this way, you can conveniently access the
files on a drive from the bash shell and from XEmacs using the /C/ prefix. Otherwise, you need to type /cygdrive/C - that is
the Cygwin convention. You can get more information on mount command by invoking mount --help. Command umount unmount the selected
mount point.


* Create your personal HOME directory.

Various applications (e.g., bash or XEmacs) store
user-specific configuration/customization files in the HOME
directory of the current user. During the installation, the HOME
directory is globally set for all users to /home/Singular. To
create your individual  HOME directory follow these steps:
1. Create a directory (folder), say, C:\home\MyHome.
2. Copy all files from /home/Singular to C:\home\MyHome.
3. Set the user environment variable HOME to C:\home\MyHome:

On Windows 95/98/ME, edit the respective line the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

On Windows NT/2K/XP add an entry in your Environment control
panel.
4. Restart your computer (On Windows 95/98/ME).
You may furthermore examine the files copied into your HOME
directory and adjust (i.e. edit) them to your personal
preferences/needs. System-wide settings are stored in the file 
/etc/profile.


Uninstalling Singular
=====================

You can uninstall individual or all installed components by opening the
Software shortcut of the Control panel. 
Simply double-click the Singular item and
follow the instructions given there.


For any other troubles,
please send an email to <mailto:singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
and include the header which is displayed by starting up Singular
with the -v option, and a description of your machine and
operating system.




E.5 Macintosh installation instructions
=======================================

For the SINGULAR version for Mac OS X refer to the Unix section.
The SINGULAR version for Mac OS 9 is available as
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/Singular-2-0-4-html.sea.hqx'
(documentation) and
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/Singular-2-0-4-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx'
(binaries and libraries).  The file
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/INSTALL_mac.txt'
gives details on how to finish the installation.




Installation preliminaries
==========================

This is the final distribution of SINGULAR as MPW tool.
Newer versions of SINGULAR will only be available for MacOS X (which is handled like other UNIX-systems).
To install SINGULAR on a Macintosh (PPC only), you need the file Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx resp. Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.hqx which you can obtain by public ftp from <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular>.
Furthermore, you need MacOS version >= 8.5 with an installed MPW shell. 
This version works also without Carbon.



Installing SINGULAR on MacOS X
==============================

Please see <INSTALL_unix.html>. 
In contrast to other Unix systems, under MacOS X, SINGULAR is only available as a shell command and there is no Emacs interface.
Enter Singular in a terminal under Aqua to run SINGULAR.
Alternatively, you may choose Terminal as the application to open the file Singular with and put it into the dock.


Installing Singular
===================

1. Make sure that you have MPW  installed on your system. 
See below for instructions on how to install MPW and how to avoid conflicts with the Carbon.lib.

2. Download the file Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx.

3. Expand the downloaded file using a standard Expander (like Compact Pro or StuffIt) to obtain the corresponding self-extracting Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea file.

4. Click on the self-extracting Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea file. 
This  will create a new folder named Singular: which contains the SINGULAR program in the subfolder 2-0-2:ppc-MPW:. 
Do not change the structure of the subfolders.

5. Make the folder which contains the executable to the working directory of the MPW shell. 
To start SINGULAR, you need to type Singular in the MPW worksheet. 
Clicking on the SINGULAR icon on the desktop, starts up the MPW shell (the working directory of the MPW shell is then the directory of the executable). 
If you start the MPW shell manually, you must set the working directory to the directory of the SINGULAR program. 
You may use the directory menu or write into the startup file of the MPW shell the line
setdirectory "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:
if "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW: is the folder of the executable.

After unpacking, you will have a directory structure like:
Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:Singular
Singular executable
Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:libparse
parser for Singular libraries
Singular:2-0-2:LIB:
Singular libraries
Singular:2-0-2:LIB:gftables:

Singular:2-0-2:doc:singular.idx

The SINGULAR libraries have a special form to work here. 
Do not use the libraries from other distributions. 
They are not compatible. 
A supplementary file is Singular-2-0-2-html.sea.hqx which contains the html pages. 
You can use this with a browser but not from the program SINGULAR.
The self-extracting archive will create the folder html: and you may extract it at "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:.



Installing MPW
==============

The final version of MPW is downloadable from Apple at <ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM_Images/>.
Older versions of Carbon.lib may conflict with the latest MPW. 
In this case, you need to update Carbon.lib or work without it.


Restrictions
============

Some typical Unix features of SINGULAR are not working with MPW, e.g. links and cooperation with other programs like XEmacs and xterm.

For any other troubles, please send an email to <mailto:singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de> and include the header which is displayed by starting up SINGULAR
with the -v option, and a description of your machine and operating system.
