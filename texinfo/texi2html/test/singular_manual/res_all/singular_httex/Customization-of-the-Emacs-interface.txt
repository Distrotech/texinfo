3.2.4 Customization of the Emacs interface
------------------------------------------

Emacs provides a convenient interface to customize the behavior of
Emacs and the SINGULAR Emacs interface for your own needs. You enter the
customize environment by either calling M-x customize (on XEmacs
you afterwards have to enter emacs in the minibuffer area) or by
selecting the menu item Options->Customize->Emacs... for XEmacs,
and the menu item Help->Customize->Toplevel Customization Group
for Emacs, resp. A brief introduction to the customization mode comes up
with the customization buffer. All customizable parameters are
hierarchically grouped and you can browse through all these groups and
change the values of the parameters using the mouse. At the end you can
safe the settings to a special file making your changes permanent.

To change the settings of the SINGULAR Emacs interface you can
either select the item Preferences of the Singular menu,
call M-x customize-group and give the argument
singular-interactive in the minibuffer area, or browse from the
top-level customization group through the path
External->Singular->Singular interactive.

The SINGULAR interface customization buffer is divided into four
groups:

* Singular Faces

Here you can specify various faces used if font-lock-mode is enabled
(which it is, by default).

* Singular Sections And Foldings

Here you can specify special faces for SINGULAR input and output
and change the text used as replacement for folded sections.

For doing this, you also might
find handy the function customize-face-at-point,
which let's you customize the face at the current position of
point. This function is automatically defined if you run
ESingular). Otherwise, you should add its definition (see below)
to your personal .emacs file.

* Singular Interactive Miscellaneous

Here you can specify various different things such as the behavior of
the cursor keys, the name of the special SINGULAR startup file, the
appearance of the help window, or the default values for the
singular command.


* Singular Demo Mode

Here you can specify how chunks of the demo file are divided, or specify
a default directory for demo files.

When you run ESingular, the settings of customized variables are
saved in the file $HOME/.emacs-singular-cust. Otherwise, the
settings are appended to your .emacs file. Among others, this
means that the customized settings of ESingular are not
automatically  taken over by a "normal" Emacs, and vice versa.
