D.5.5.12 stripHNE
.................
Procedure from library hnoether.lib (see hnoether_lib).

Usage:
stripHNE(L); L list

Assume:
L is the output of develop(f), or of
extdevelop(develop(f),n), or (one entry of) the list
hne in the ring created by hnexpansion(f[,"ess"]).

Return:
list in the same format as L, but all polynomials L[4], resp.
L[i][4], are set to zero.

Note:
The purpose of this procedure is to remove huge amounts of data
no longer needed. It is useful, if one or more of the polynomials
in L consume much memory. It is still possible to compute invariants,
parametrizations etc. with the stripped HNE(s), but it is not possible
to use extdevelop with them.

Example:
LIB "hnoether.lib";
ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
list hne=develop(x2+y3+y4);
hne;
==> [1]:
==>    _[1,1]=0
==>    _[1,2]=x
==>    _[2,1]=0
==>    _[2,2]=-1
==> [2]:
==>    1,-1
==> [3]:
==>    1
==> [4]:
==>    x4-2x2y+y2+y
==> [5]:
==>    1
stripHNE(hne);
==> [1]:
==>    _[1,1]=0
==>    _[1,2]=x
==>    _[2,1]=0
==>    _[2,2]=-1
==> [2]:
==>    1,-1
==> [3]:
==>    1
==> [4]:
==>    0
