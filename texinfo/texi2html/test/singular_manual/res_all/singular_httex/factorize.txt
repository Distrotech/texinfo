5.1.30 factorize
----------------

Syntax:
factorize ( poly_expression )

factorize ( poly_expression, 0 )

factorize ( poly_expression, 2 )
Type:
list of ideal and intvec


Syntax:
factorize ( poly_expression, 1 )
Type:
ideal
Purpose:
computes the irreducible factors (as an ideal) of the polynomial
together with or without
the multiplicities (as an intvec) depending on the second argument:
    0: returns factors and multiplicities, first factor is a constant.
       May also be written with only one argument.
    1: returns non-constant factors (no multiplicities).
    2: returns non-constant factors and multiplicities.
Note:
Not implemented for the coefficient fields real and finite fields of
type (p^n,a).
Example:
  ring r=32003,(x,y,z),dp;
  factorize(9*(x-1)^2*(y+z));
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=9
==>    _[2]=y+z
==>    _[3]=x-1
==> [2]:
==>    1,1,2
  factorize(9*(x-1)^2*(y+z),1);
==> _[1]=y+z
==> _[2]=x-1
  factorize(9*(x-1)^2*(y+z),2);
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=y+z
==>    _[2]=x-1
==> [2]:
==>    1,2
