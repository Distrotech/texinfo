C.6.3 The Buchberger algorithm for toric ideals
-----------------------------------------------

Toric ideals have a very special structure that allows us to improve
the Buchberger algorithm in many respects: They are prime ideals and
generated by binomials. Pottier used this fact to describe all
operations of the Buchberger algorithm on the ideal generators in terms
of vector additions and subtractions. Some other strategies like
multiple reduction (see [CoTr91]) or the use of bit
vectors to represent the support of a monomial (see [Big97]) may be
applied to more general ideals, but show to
be especially useful in the toric case.
