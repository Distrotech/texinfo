D.7.5.14 SQFRNormMain
.....................
Procedure from library zeroset.lib (see zeroset_lib).

Usage:
SQFRNorm(f); where f is a polynomial

Purpose:
compute the norm of the squarefree polynomial f in Q(a)[x].

Return:
list with 3 entries
    _[1] = squarefree norm of g (poly)
  _[2] = g (= f(x - s*a)) (poly)
  _[3] = s (int)
  

Assume:
f must be squarefree, basering = Q[x,a] and ideal mpoly is equal to
'minpoly',this represents the ring Q(a)[x] together with 'minpoly'.

Note:
the norm is an element of Q[x]
