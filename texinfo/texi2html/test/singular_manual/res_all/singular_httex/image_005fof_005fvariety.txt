D.6.1.31 image_of_variety
.........................
Procedure from library finvar.lib (see finvar_lib).

Usage:
image_of_variety(I,F);

I: an arbitrary <ideal>, F: a 1xm <matrix> defining an invariant ring
of a some matrix group

Return:
the <ideal> defining the image under that group of the variety defined
by I

Theory:
relative_orbit_variety(I,F,s) is called and the newly introduced
variables in the output are replaced by the generators of the
invariant ring. This ideal in the original variables defines the image
of the variety defined by I

Example:
LIB "finvar.lib";
ring R=0,(x,y,z),dp;
matrix F[1][3]=x+y+z,xy+xz+yz,xyz;
ideal I=xy;
print(image_of_variety(I,F));
==> xyz
