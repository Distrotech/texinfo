3.9 Guidelines for writing a library
====================================

Although there are very few enforced rules on how libraries are written
(see Libraries), it is recommended that the libraries comply with
the guidelines explained in this section, so that debugging and
understanding are made easier.

Note: For libraries which are to be included in the SINGULAR
distribution, the following guidelines are mandatory.

* Procedures in a library::
* Documentation of a library::
* Typesetting of help strings::
* The help string of a library::
* The help string of procedures::
