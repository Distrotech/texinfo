6.1 Limitations
===============

SINGULAR has the following limitations:
* the characteristic of a prime field must be less than 2147483629 
* the (weighted) degree of a monomial must be smaller than the largest long,
usually 2147483648
* the exponent of a ring variable must be smaller than 32768
unless the ring ordering start with the pseudo ordering 
L( max_exponent )
* the rank of any free module must be smaller than the largest long,
usually 2147483648
* the number of parameters must be smaller than 32768
* the number of ring variables must be smaller than 32768
* the precision of long floating point numbers (for ground field real)
must be smaller than 32768
* integers (of type int) have the limited range
from -2147483647 to 2147483647
* floating point numbers (type number from field real) have
a limited range which is machine dependent. A typical range is -1.0e-38
to 1.0e+38.  The string representation of overflow and underflow is
machine dependent, as well. For example "Inf" on Linux, or 
"+.+00e+00" on HPUX.
* the length of an identifier is unlimited but listvar
displays only the first 20 characters
* statements may not contain more than 10000 tokens
* All input to Singular must be 7-bit clean, i.e. special characters like the
the German Umlaute (a", o", etc.), or the French accent characters may 
neither appear as input to SINGULAR, nor in libraries or procedure
definitions.
