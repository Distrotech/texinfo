D.4.9.2 normalI
...............
Procedure from library reesclos.lib (see reesclos_lib).

Usage:
normalI(I [,p[,c]]); I an ideal, p and c optional integers

Return:
the integral closure of I,...,I^p. If p is not given, or p==0,
compute the closure of all powers up to the maximum degree in t
occurring in the generators of the closure of R[It] (so this is the
last one that is not just the sum/product of the above ones).
c is transferred to the procedure primeClosure and toggles its
behavior in computing the integral closure of R[It].

The result is a list containing the closure of the desired powers of
I as ideals of the basering.

Example:
LIB "reesclos.lib";
ring R=0,(x,y),dp;
ideal I = x2,xy4,y5;
list J = normalI(I);
I;
==> I[1]=x2
==> I[2]=xy4
==> I[3]=y5
J;                             // J[1] is the integral closure of I
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=x2
==>    _[2]=y5
==>    _[3]=-xy3
