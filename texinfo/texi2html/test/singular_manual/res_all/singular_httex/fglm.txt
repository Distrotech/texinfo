5.1.32 fglm
-----------

Syntax:
fglm ( ring_name, ideal_name )
Type:
ideal
Purpose:
computes for the given ideal in the given ring
a reduced Groebner basis in the current ring, by applying the so-called FGLM
(Faugere, Gianni, Lazard, Mora)  algorithm.

The main application is to compute a lexicographical Groebner basis
from a reduced Groebner basis with respect to a degree ordering. This
can be much faster than computing a lexicographical Groebner basis
directly.
Note:
The ideal must be zero-dimensional and given as a reduced Groebner
basis in the given ring.

The only permissible differences between the given ring and the current ring
are the monomial ordering and a permutation of the variables,
resp. parameters.
Example:
  ring r=0,(x,y,z),dp;
  ideal i=y3+x2, x2y+x2, x3-x2, z4-x2-y;
  option(redSB);   // force the computation of a reduced SB
  i=std(i);
  vdim(i);
==> 28
  ring s=0,(z,x,y),lp;
  ideal j=fglm(r,i);
  j;
==> j[1]=y4+y3
==> j[2]=xy3-y3
==> j[3]=x2+y3
==> j[4]=z4+y3-y
