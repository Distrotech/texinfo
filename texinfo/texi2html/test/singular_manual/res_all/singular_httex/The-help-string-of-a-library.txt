3.9.4 The help string of a library
----------------------------------

The help (or, info) string of a library should have the following format:

info="
LIBRARY: <library_name> <one line description of the content>
AUTHOR:  <name, and email address of author>
[SEE ALSO: <comma-separated words of cross references>]
[KEYWORDS: <semicolon-separated phrases of index keys>]
PROCEDURES:
  <procedure1>;     <one line description of the purpose>
   .
   .
  <procedureN>;     <one line description of the purpose>
";
Only such procedures should be listed in the PROCEDURE section
which are not static and which
have a help and example section.

The purpose of the one line procedure descriptions is not to give a short help
for the procedure, but to help the user decide what procedure might be
the right one for the job. Details can then be found in the help section
of each procedure. Therefore parameters may be omitted or abbreviated if
necessary. If this description consists of only upper-case characters,
then it will be typeset in all lowercase characters in the manual.

For more information, see Typesetting of help strings. For an
example, see template_lib.
