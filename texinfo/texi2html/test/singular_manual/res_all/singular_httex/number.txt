4.11 number
===========

Numbers are elements from the coefficient field (or ground field).
They can only be defined or accessed with respect to a basering
which determines the coefficient field. See ring declarations for
declarations of coefficient fields.

Warning: Beware of the special meaning of the letter e
(immediately following a sequence of digits) if the field is real (or complex).
See number operations, Miscellaneous oddities.
