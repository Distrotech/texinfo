3.1.6 Command line options
--------------------------

The synopsis of SINGULAR is
Singular  [options] [file1 [file2 ...]]
ESingular  [options] [file1 [file2 ...]]
Options can be given in both, their long and short format. The following
options control the general behavior of SINGULAR:
-d, --sdb
Enable the use of the source code debugger.
See Source code debugger.

-e, --echo[=VAL]
Set value of variable echo to VAL (integer in the range
0, ..., 9). Without an argument, echo is set to 1, which echoes
all input coming from a file. By default, the value of echo is
0. See echo.

-h, --help
Print a one-line description of each command line option and exit.

--allow-net
Allow the netscape and html help browser to fetch HTML manual pages over
the net from the WWW home-site of SINGULAR. See The online help system, for more info.

--browser=VAL
Use VAL as browser for the SINGULAR online manual.

VAL may be one of html (Windows only), netscape, xinfo,
tkinfo, info, builtin, or emacs. Depending
on your platform and local
installation, only some browsers might be available. The default browser
is html for Windows and netscape for Unix
platforms. See The online help system, for more info.

--no-rc
Do not execute the .singularrc file on start-up.  By default,
this file is executed on start-up.  See Startup sequence.

--no-stdlib
Do not load the library standard.lib on start-up. By default,
this library is loaded on start-up.  See Startup sequence.

--no-warn
Do not display warning messages.

--no-out
Suppress display of all output.

-t, --no-tty
Do not redefine the terminal characteristics.  This option should be
used for batch processes.

-q, --quiet
Do not print the start-up banner and messages when loading
libraries. Furthermore, redirect stderr
(all error messages) to stdout (normal output channel).  This
option should be used if SINGULAR's output is redirected to a file.

-v, --verbose
Print extended information about the version and configuration of
SINGULAR  (used optional parts, compilation date, start of random
generator etc.). This information should be included if a user reports
an error to the authors.

The following command line options allow manipulations of the timer and
the pseudo random generator and enable the passing of commands and strings
to SINGULAR:

-c, --execute=STRING
Execute STRING as (a sequence of) SINGULAR commands on
start-up after the .singularrc file is executed, but prior to
executing the files given on the command line.  E.g., Singular -c
"help all.lib; quit;" shows the help for the library all.lib and
exits.

-u, --user-option=STRING
Returns STRING on system("--user-option"). This is useful
for passing arbitrary arguments from the command line to the
SINGULAR interpreter.  E.g.,

Singular -u "xxx.dump" -c 'getdump(system("--user-option"))'
reads the file xxx.dump at
start-up and allows the user to start working with all the objects
defined in a previous session.

-r, --random=SEED
Seed (i.e., set the initial value of) the pseudo random generator with
integer SEED.  If this option is not given, then the random
generator is seeded with a time-based SEED (the number of
seconds since January, 1, 1970, on Unix-like operating systems, to be
precise).

--min-time=SECS
If the timer (see timer), resp.  rtimer
(see rtimer) , variable is
set, report only
times larger than SECS seconds (SECS needs to be a
floating point number greater than 0).  By default, this value is set to
0.5 (i.e., half a second).  E.g., the option --min-time=0.01
forces SINGULAR to report all times larger than 1/100 of a
second.

--ticks-per-sec=TICKS
Set unit of timer to TICKS ticks per second (i.e., the value
reported by the timer and rtimer variable divided by
TICKS gives the time in seconds).  By default, this value is 1.


The next three options are of interest for the use with MP links:
-b, --batch
Run in MP batch mode. Opens a TCP/IP connection with host specified by
--MPhost at the port specified by --MPport. Input is read
from and output is written to this connection in the MP format.
See MPtcp links.

--MPport=PORT
Use PORT as default port number for MP connections (whenever not
further specified). This option is mandatory when the --batch
option is given.  See MPtcp links.

--MPhost=HOST
Use HOST as default host for MP connections (whenever not
further specified).  This option is mandatory when the --batch
option is given.  See MPtcp links.

Finally, the following options are only available when running
ESingular (see Running SINGULAR under Emacs for details).

--emacs=EMACS
Use EMACS as Emacs program to run the SINGULAR Emacs
interface, where EMACS may e.g. be emacs ore xemacs.

--emacs-dir=DIR
Set the singular-emacs-home-directory, which is the directory where
singular.el can be found, to DIR.

--emacs-load=FILE
Load FILE on Emacs start-up, instead of the default load file.

--singular=PROG
Start PROG as SINGULAR program within Emacs

The value of options given to SINGULAR (resp. their default values,
if an option was not given), can be checked with the command
system("--long_option_name").  See system.
  system("--quiet");    // if ``quiet'' 1, otherwise 0
==> 1
  system("--min-time"); // minimal reported time
==> 0.5
  system("--random");   // seed of the random generator
==> 12345678

Furthermore, the value of options (e.g., --browser) can be
re-set while SINGULAR is running with the command
system("--long_option_name_string ",expression). See system.
  system("--browser", "builtin");  // sets browser to 'builtin'
  system("--ticks-per-sec", 100);  // sets timer resolution to 100
