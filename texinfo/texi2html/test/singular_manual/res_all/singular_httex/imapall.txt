D.2.6.9 imapall
...............
Procedure from library ring.lib (see ring_lib).

Usage:
imapall(R[,s]); R=ring/qring, s=string

Create:
map all objects of ring R (of type poly/ideal/vector/module/number/
matrix) into the basering, by applying imap to all objects of R.
If no 3rd argument is present, the names are the same as in R. If,
say, f is a poly in R and the 3rd argument is the string "R", then f
is mapped to f_R etc.

Return:
no return value

Note:
As imap, this procedure maps the variables of R to the variables with
the same name in the basering, the other variables are mapped to 0.
The 3rd argument is useful in order to avoid conflicts of names, the
empty string is allowed

Caution:
imapall does not work inside a procedure

It does not work if R contains a map

Example:
LIB "ring.lib";
// The example is not shown since imapall does not work in a procedure
// (and hence not in the example procedure). Try the following commands:
//   ring R=0,(x,y,z,u),dp;
//   ideal j=x,y,z,u2+ux+z;
//   matrix M[2][3]=1,2,3,x,y,uz;
//   j; print(M);
//   ring S=0,(a,b,c,x,z,y),ds;
//   imapall(R);         //map from R to S: x->x, y->y, z->z, u->0
//   names(S);
//   j; print(M);
//   imapall(S,"1");     //identity map of S: copy objects, change names
//   names(S);
//   kill R,S;
