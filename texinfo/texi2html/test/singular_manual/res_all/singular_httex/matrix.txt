4.9 matrix
==========

Objects of type matrix are matrices with polynomial entries.
Like polynomials they can
only be defined or accessed with respect to a basering. In order to
compute with matrices having integer or rational entries define a ring
with characteristic 0 and at least one variable.

A matrix can be multiplied by and added to a poly; in this case the
poly is converted into a matrix of the right size with the poly on the
diagonal.

If A is a matrix then the assignment module M=A; or module
M=module(A); creates a module generated by the columns of A.  Note that
the trailing zero columns of A may be deleted by module operations with
M.
