D.7.3.3 triangM
...............
Procedure from library triang.lib (see triang_lib).

Usage:
triangM(G[,i]); G=ideal, i=integer,


Assume:
G is the reduced lexicographical Groebner bases of the
zero-dimensional ideal (G), sorted by increasing leading terms.

Return:
a list of finitely many triangular systems, such that
the union of their varieties equals the variety of (G).
If i = 2, then each polynomial of the triangular systems
is factorized.

Note:
Algorithm of Moeller (see: Moeller, H.M.:

On decomposing systems of polynomial equations with

finitely many solutions, Appl. Algebra Eng. Commun. Comput. 4,
217 - 230, 1993).

Example:
LIB "triang.lib";
ring rC5 = 0,(e,d,c,b,a),lp;
triangM(stdfglm(cyclic(5))); //oder: triangM(stdfglm(cyclic(5)),2);
