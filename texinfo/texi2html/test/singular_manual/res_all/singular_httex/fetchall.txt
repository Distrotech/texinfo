D.2.6.8 fetchall
................
Procedure from library ring.lib (see ring_lib).

Usage:
fetchall(R[,s]); R=ring/qring, s=string

Create:
fetch all objects of ring R (of type poly/ideal/vector/module/number/
matrix) into the basering.

If no 3rd argument is present, the names are the same as in R. If,
say, f is a poly in R and the 3rd argument is the string "R", then f
is mapped to f_R etc.

Return:
no return value

Note:
As fetch, this procedure maps the 1st, 2nd, ... variable of R to the
1st, 2nd, ... variable of the basering.

The 3rd argument is useful in order to avoid conflicts of names, the
empty string is allowed

Caution:
fetchall does not work inside a procedure.

It does not work if R contains a map.

Example:
LIB "ring.lib";
// The example is not shown since fetchall does not work in a procedure;
// (and hence not in the example procedure). Try the following commands:
//   ring R=0,(x,y,z),dp;
//   ideal j=x,y2,z2;
//   matrix M[2][3]=1,2,3,x,y,z;
//   j; print(M);
//   ring S=0,(a,b,c),ds;
//   fetchall(R);       //map from R to S: x->a, y->b, z->c;
//   names(S);
//   j; print(M);
//   fetchall(S,"1");   //identity map of S: copy objects, change names
//   names(S);
//   kill R,S;
