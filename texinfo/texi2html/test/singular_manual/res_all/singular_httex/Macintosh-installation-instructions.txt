E.5 Macintosh installation instructions
=======================================

For the SINGULAR version for Mac OS X refer to the Unix section.
The SINGULAR version for Mac OS 9 is available as
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/Singular-2-0-4-html.sea.hqx'
(documentation) and
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/Singular-2-0-4-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx'
(binaries and libraries).  The file
`ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/MAC/classic/INSTALL_mac.txt'
gives details on how to finish the installation.




Installation preliminaries
==========================

This is the final distribution of SINGULAR as MPW tool.
Newer versions of SINGULAR will only be available for MacOS X (which is handled like other UNIX-systems).
To install SINGULAR on a Macintosh (PPC only), you need the file Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx resp. Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.hqx which you can obtain by public ftp from <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular>.
Furthermore, you need MacOS version >= 8.5 with an installed MPW shell. 
This version works also without Carbon.



Installing SINGULAR on MacOS X
==============================

Please see <INSTALL_unix.html>. 
In contrast to other Unix systems, under MacOS X, SINGULAR is only available as a shell command and there is no Emacs interface.
Enter Singular in a terminal under Aqua to run SINGULAR.
Alternatively, you may choose Terminal as the application to open the file Singular with and put it into the dock.


Installing Singular
===================

1. Make sure that you have MPW  installed on your system. 
See below for instructions on how to install MPW and how to avoid conflicts with the Carbon.lib.

2. Download the file Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea.hqx.

3. Expand the downloaded file using a standard Expander (like Compact Pro or StuffIt) to obtain the corresponding self-extracting Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea file.

4. Click on the self-extracting Singular-2-0-2-ppc-MPW.sea file. 
This  will create a new folder named Singular: which contains the SINGULAR program in the subfolder 2-0-2:ppc-MPW:. 
Do not change the structure of the subfolders.

5. Make the folder which contains the executable to the working directory of the MPW shell. 
To start SINGULAR, you need to type Singular in the MPW worksheet. 
Clicking on the SINGULAR icon on the desktop, starts up the MPW shell (the working directory of the MPW shell is then the directory of the executable). 
If you start the MPW shell manually, you must set the working directory to the directory of the SINGULAR program. 
You may use the directory menu or write into the startup file of the MPW shell the line
setdirectory "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:
if "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW: is the folder of the executable.

After unpacking, you will have a directory structure like:
Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:Singular
Singular executable
Singular:2-0-2:ppc-MPW:libparse
parser for Singular libraries
Singular:2-0-2:LIB:
Singular libraries
Singular:2-0-2:LIB:gftables:
Singular gftables
Singular:2-0-2:doc:singular.idx
index of inline help
Singular:2-0-2:doc:singular.hlp

Singular:2-0-2:README

The SINGULAR libraries have a special form to work here. 
Do not use the libraries from other distributions. 
They are not compatible. 
A supplementary file is Singular-2-0-2-html.sea.hqx which contains the html pages. 
You can use this with a browser but not from the program SINGULAR.
The self-extracting archive will create the folder html: and you may extract it at "{Boot}"Singular:2-0-2:.



Installing MPW
==============

The final version of MPW is downloadable from Apple at <ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./MPW-GM_Images/>.
Older versions of Carbon.lib may conflict with the latest MPW. 
In this case, you need to update Carbon.lib or work without it.


Restrictions
============

Some typical Unix features of SINGULAR are not working with MPW, e.g. links and cooperation with other programs like XEmacs and xterm.

For any other troubles, please send an email to <mailto:singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de> and include the header which is displayed by starting up SINGULAR
with the -v option, and a description of your machine and operating system.
