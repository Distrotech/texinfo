D.7.2.12 triang_solve
.....................
Procedure from library solve.lib (see solve_lib).

Usage:
triang_solve(l,p [, d] ); l=list, p,d=integers,

l a list of finitely many triangular systems, such that the union of
their varieties equals the variety of the initial ideal.

p>0: gives precision of complex numbers in digits,

d>0: gives precision (1<d<p) for near-zero-determination,

(default: d=1/2*p).

Assume:
the ground field has char 0;

l was computed using Algorithm of Lazard or Algorithm of Moeller
(see triang.lib).

Return:
nothing

Create:
The procedure creates a ring rC with the same number of variables but
with complex coefficients (and precision p).

In rC a list rlist of numbers is created, in which the complex
roots of i are stored.


Example:
LIB "solve.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y),lp;
// compute the intersection points of two curves
ideal s=  x2 + y2 - 10, x2 + xy + 2y2 - 16;
triang_solve(triangLfak(stdfglm(s)),10);
==> // name of new ring: rC
==> // list of roots: rlist
rlist;
