E.4 Windows installation instructions
=====================================






For the impatient:
==================
* If you run Windows NT/2K/XP, make sure you are logged in with the
Administrator rights.
* If you have some older version of Singular installed, please uninstall it
before installing Singular-2-0-4. It is recommended to
install the new Singular in the same directory where the previous
version was installed. Thus your existing environment will be used automatically.
* If you have Cygwin or XEmacs installed and they do not belong
of some previous Singular installation,
please read the information below.
* Execute the self-extracting installation archive and
carefully follow the instructions given there. 
Setup will analyze your system, create the corresponding configuration
and give you further tips on the installation process.
* In case of troubles, see the installed files /etc/INSTALL.txt,
/etc/TROUBLESHOOTING.txt or visit
the Singular Forum at <http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum>.


Installation preliminaries
==========================

Running Singular on MS Windows requires that the Cygwin DLL
(dynamically linked library) version 1.3.9 or higher is installed on your
system (see <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/> for details about
Cygwin). We install and configure Cygwin version 1.3.9 automatically, if
the BasicCygwin component is selected (default setting).

To run ESingular (i.e. Singular within its Emacs interface) on
MS Windows requires furthermore that the XEmacs editor is installed on
your system. We install and configure XEmacs version 21.1.13 automatically, if the XEmacs component is selected.


The Singular installation is divided into the following
components (you see them explicitly if you choose the Custom Setup Type
during the installation):
Program Files:
        Singular
Contains the Singular Program, documentation and example files.

All files of this component are installed under the directory
/usr/local/Singular/2-0-4
BasicCygwin
Contains the Cygwin DLL and basic tools/programs (like bash or
info) of the  Cygwin environment.

The Cygwin DLL and programs are installed in the directory
/bin. Miscellaneous documentation and configuration files are
installed into the directory /etc.
XEmacs
Contains the Cygwin port of the XEmacs editor (see
<http://www.xemacs.org> for more about XEmacs) version 21.1.13.

All files of this component are installed under the directory
/usr/local.
ESingular
Contains the ESingular, the most comfortable Singular interface.
Requires XEmacs to run.
        Remark:
All essential DLLs, some programs and symbolic links are installed in the directory
/usr/local/Singular/2-0-4/ix86-Win, which must be present in your PATH system variable.
Help Files:
WinHelp
Contains Singular Manual, converted to Windows help format (.hlp).
We recommend to install it, because it is small in size. Moreover,
we set it as default help browser in all the Singular executables.
HTML Help
Contains the "native" Singular Manual. It's not included by default,
because it is much bigger than WinHelp, though it has better typesetting
of mathematical formulae.

The Typical Setup Type of the Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe contains
BasicCygwin, Singular, 
XEmacs, ESingular, WinHelp and HTML Help 
components. The Compact Setup Type does not contain only the HTML Help component.

Downloading preliminaries
=========================

To install Singular on a PC running Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP, you need
to download one of the following archive files:

Minimal archive: Singular-2-0-4-Compact.exe <Singular-2-0-4-Compact.exe>      (BasicCygwin, Singular, WinHelp components)

Typical archive : Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe <Singular-2-0-4-Typical.exe>      (BasicCygwin, Singular, XEmacs, ESingular, WinHelp, HTML Help components)

You can obtain these (and other) archives 
either from the WINDOWS directory on the Singular CD or from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/>.



Installing Singular
===================

The recent Setup program analyzes your system, e.g. it detects
whether Cygwin and XEmacs are present and functional. Then it gives you
hints and/or error messages with instructions during the installation.

If you have Cygwin installed
        If the version of cygwin1.dll is not less than 1.3.9,
        you will be prompted that the BasicCygwin component will not
        be installed. Moreover, the existing Cygwin root directory will be proposed as
        the default installation directory. You can accept it, then
        Singular will be placed into the existing Cygwin environment.
        If you choose another destination, Singular will use Cygwin
        programs anyway. If your Cygwin has incorrect settings (like
        inconsistent mount points among the important ones), Singular
        Setup will correct them. 

      If setup could not detect cygwin, present in the system, you
        can try to break the installation, start it once more, choose the
        "Custom" setup type and unselect the BasicCygwin component.

If you have XEmacs installed
        The Cygwin port of XEmacs version 21.1.13 together 
        with the most
        important packages is included in the distribution. The use of 
        non-Cygwin ports or earlier Cygwin ports has some 
        quirks and does not work 
        properly together with Singular (i.e., running ESingular 
        results in problems). Nevertheless, if you want to test the
        compatibility of ESingular with your own XEmacs, just
        de-select the XEmacs component, but leave ESingular selected.
        If your XEmacs happens to be incompatible with ESingular, you can
        install just the XEmacs component and use in fact two different
        XEmacs programs. 
        The setup program will search for XEmacs and packages 
        in <TARGETDIR>/usr/local/lib (here <TARGETDIR> is the directory which you selected while running setup). If you have Cygwin and the Cygwin port of
        XEmacs, you might have XEmacs installed there. To avoid overwriting your XEmacs files, setup will ask you what to do.


Customizing Singular
====================

The following step(s) are optional:
* To conveniently access all files on your computer, mount the drives of
your disk(s):
1. Open a rxvt terminal (from Start->Programs->Singular 2.0->Tools).
2. For each drive (letter) issue the following command (the drive C:
is used in the example):
mount -f -s -t C: /C
After mounting the drive(s) this way, you can conveniently access the
files on a drive from the bash shell and from XEmacs using the /C/ prefix. Otherwise, you need to type /cygdrive/C - that is
the Cygwin convention. You can get more information on mount command by invoking mount --help. Command umount unmount the selected
mount point.


* Create your personal HOME directory.

Various applications (e.g., bash or XEmacs) store
user-specific configuration/customization files in the HOME
directory of the current user. During the installation, the HOME
directory is globally set for all users to /home/Singular. To
create your individual  HOME directory follow these steps:
1. Create a directory (folder), say, C:\home\MyHome.
2. Copy all files from /home/Singular to C:\home\MyHome.
3. Set the user environment variable HOME to C:\home\MyHome:

On Windows 95/98/ME, edit the respective line the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

On Windows NT/2K/XP add an entry in your Environment control
panel.
4. Restart your computer (On Windows 95/98/ME).
You may furthermore examine the files copied into your HOME
directory and adjust (i.e. edit) them to your personal
preferences/needs. System-wide settings are stored in the file 
/etc/profile.


Uninstalling Singular
=====================

You can uninstall individual or all installed components by opening the
Software shortcut of the Control panel. 
Simply double-click the Singular item and
follow the instructions given there.


For any other troubles,

and include the header which is displayed by starting up Singular
with the -v option, and a description of your machine and
operating system.
