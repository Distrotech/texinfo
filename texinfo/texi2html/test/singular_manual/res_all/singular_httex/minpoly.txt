5.3.3 minpoly
-------------
Type:
number
Purpose:
describes the coefficient field of the current basering as
an algebraic extension with the minimal polynomial equal to minpoly.
Setting the minpoly should be the first command after
defining the ring.
Note:
The minimal polynomial has to be specified in the syntax of a polynomial.
Its variable is not one of the ring variables, but the algebraic element
which is being adjoined to the field.
Algebraic extensions in SINGULAR are only possible over the rational
numbers or over Z/p, p a prime number.

SINGULAR does not check whether the given
polynomial is irreducible! It can be checked in advance with the
function factorize (see factorize).
Example:
  //(Q[i]/(i^2+1))[x,y,z]:
  ring Cxyz=(0,i),(x,y,z),dp;
  minpoly=i^2+1;
  i2;  //this is a number, not a poly
==> -1
