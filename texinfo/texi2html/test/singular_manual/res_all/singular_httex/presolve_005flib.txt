Procedures:
* degreepart:: elements of id of total degree >= d1 and <= d2
* elimlinearpart:: linear part eliminated from id
* elimpart:: partial elimination of vars [among first n vars]
* elimpartanyr:: factors of p partially eliminated from i in any ring
* fastelim:: fast elimination of factors of p from i [options]
* findvars:: ideal of variables occurring in id [more information]
* hilbvec:: intvec of Hilbert-series of id [in char c and ord o]
* linearpart:: elements of id of total degree <=1
* tolessvars:: maps id to new basering having only vars occurring in id
* solvelinearpart:: reduced std-basis of linear part of id
* sortandmap:: map to new basering with vars sorted w.r.t. complexity
* sortvars:: sort vars w.r.t. complexity in id [different blocks]
* shortid:: generators of id having <= n terms
* valvars:: valuation of vars w.r.t. to their complexity in id
* idealSimplify:: eliminates variables which are linear in id
* idealSplit:: intersection of the ideals has the same radical as id
