4.15 resolution
===============

The resolution type is intended as an intermediate representation which
internally retains additional information obtained during computation of
resolutions. It furthermore enables the use of partial results to
compute, for example, Betti numbers or minimal resolutions. Like ideals
and modules, a resolution can only be defined w.r.t. a basering.

Note:
to access the elements of a resolution, it has to be assigned to a list,
which also completes computations and may therefore take time,
(resp. an access directly with the brackets [ , ] causes
implicitly a cast to a list).
