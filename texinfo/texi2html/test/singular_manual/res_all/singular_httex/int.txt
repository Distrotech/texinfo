4.3 int
=======

Variables of type int represent the machine integers and are, therefore,
limited  in their range (e.g., the range is between
-2147483647 and 2147483647 on 32-bit machines). They are mainly used
to count things (dimension, rank, etc.),
in loops (see for), and
to represent boolean values
(FALSE is represented by 0, every other value means TRUE, see
boolean expressions).

Integers consist of a sequence of digits, possibly preceded by a sign.
A space is considered as a separator, so it is not allowed between digits.
A sequence of digits outside the allowed range is converted to the type
number if possible.
