D.7.2.7 lex_solve
.................
Procedure from library solve.lib (see solve_lib).

Usage:
lex_solve( i[,p] ); i=ideal, p=integer,
   p>0: gives precision of complex numbers in decimal digits (default: p=30).
 

Assume:
i is a reduced lexicographical Groebner bases of a zero-dimensional
ideal, sorted by increasing leading terms.

Return:
nothing

Create:
The procedure creates a complec ring with the same variables but
with complex coefficients (and precision p).

In this ring a list rlist of numbers is created, in which the complex
roots of i are stored.

Example:
LIB "solve.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y),lp;
// compute the intersection points of two curves
ideal s=  x2 + y2 - 10, x2 + xy + 2y2 - 16;
lex_solve(stdfglm(s),10);
==> // name of new ring: rC
==> // list of roots: rlist
rlist;
