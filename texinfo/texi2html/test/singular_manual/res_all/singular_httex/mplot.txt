D.8.1.3 mplot
.............
Procedure from library graphics.lib (see graphics_lib).

Usage:
mplot(fname, I [,I1,I2,..,s] ); fname=string; I,I1,I2,..=ideals,
s=string representing the plot region.

Use the ideals I1,I2,.. in order to produce multiple plots (they need
to have the same number of entries as I!).

Return:
string, text with Mathematica commands to display a plot

Note:
The plotregion is defaulted to -1,1 around zero.

For implicit given curves enter first the string returned by
proc mathinit into Mathematica in order to load ImplicitPlot.
The following conventions for I are used:
    - ideal with 2 entries in one variable means a parametrised plane curve,
  - ideal with 3 entries in one variable means a parametrised space curve,
  - ideal with 3 entries in two variables means a parametrised surface,
  - ideal with 2 entries in two variables means an implicit curve
    given as I[1]==I[2],
  - ideal with 1 entry (or one polynomial) in two variables means
    an implicit curve given as  f == 0,
  

Example:
LIB "graphics.lib";
// ---------  plane curves ------------
ring rr0 = 0,x,dp; export rr0;
ideal I = x3 + x, x2;
ideal J = x2, -x+x3;
mplot("",I,J,"-2,2");
// Paste the output into a Mathematica notebook
// active evalutation of the cell with SHIFT RETURN
// --------- space curves --------------
I = x3,-1/10x3+x2,x2;
mplot("",I);
// Paste the output into a Mathematica notebook
// active evalutation of the cell with SHIFT RETURN
// ----------- surfaces -------------------
ring rr1 = 0,(x,y),dp; export rr1;
ideal J = xy,y,x2;
mplot("",J,"-2,1","1,2");
// Paste the output into a Mathematica notebook
// active evalutation of the cell with SHIFT RETURN
kill rr0,rr1;
