3.1.5 Editing input
-------------------


The following keys can be used for editing the input and retrieving
previous input lines:
TAB
provides command line completion for function names and file names
CTRL-B
moves cursor left
CTRL-F
moves cursor right
CTRL-A
moves cursor to beginning of line
CTRL-E
moves cursor to end of line
CTRL-D
deletes character under cursor

 Warning: on an empty line, CTRL-D is interpreted as the
EOF character which immediately terminates SINGULAR.
BACKSPACE
DELETE
CTRL-H
deletes character before cursor
CTRL-K
kills from cursor to end of line
CTRL-U
kills from cursor to beginning of line
CTRL-N
saves current line on history and gives next line
CTRL-P
saves current line on history and gives previous line
RETURN
saves the current line to the history and
sends it to the SINGULAR parser for interpretation

When run under a Unix-like operating system and in its ASCII-terminal
user interface,   SINGULAR tries to dynamically link at runtime
with the GNU Readline library. See Command Line Editing in The GNU Readline Library Manual, for more information. If a shared version of this library can
be found on your machine, then additional command-line editing
features like  history completion are available.
In particular, if SINGULAR is able to load that library and
if the environment
variable SINGULARHIST is set and has a name of a file as value,
then the input history is stored across sessions using this
file. Otherwise, i.e., if the environment variable SINGULARHIST
is not set, then the history of the last inputs is only available for
the commands of the current session.
