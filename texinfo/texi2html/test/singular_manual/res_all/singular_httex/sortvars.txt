D.7.1.12 sortvars
.................
Procedure from library presolve.lib (see presolve_lib).

Usage:
sortvars(id[,n1,p1,n2,p2,...]);

id=poly/ideal/vector/module,

p1,p2,...= polynomials (product of vars),

n1,n2,...=integers

(default: p1=product of all vars, n1=0)

the last pi (containing the remaining vars) may be omitted

Compute:
sort variables with respect to their complexity in id

Return:
list of two elements, an ideal and a list:
    [1]: ideal, variables of basering sorted w.r.t their complexity in id
       ni controls the ordering in i-th block (= vars occurring in pi):
       ni=0 (resp.!=0) means that less (resp. more) complex vars come first
  [2]: a list with 4 entries for each pi:
       ideal ai : vars of pi in correct order,
       intvec vi: permutation vector describing the ordering in ai,
       intmat Mi: valuation matrix of ai, the columns of Mi being the
                  valuation vectors of the vars in ai
       intvec wi: size of 1-st, 2-nd,... block of identical columns of Mi
                  (vars with same valuation)
  

Note:
We define a variable x to be more complex than y (with respect to id)
if val(x) > val(y) lexicographically, where val(x) denotes the
valuation vector of x:

consider id as list of polynomials in x with coefficients in the
remaining variables. Then:

val(x) = (maximal occurring power of x, # of all monomials in leading
coefficient, # of all monomials in coefficient of next smaller power
of x,...).

Example:
LIB "presolve.lib";
ring s=0,(x,y,z,w),dp;
ideal i = x3+y2+yw2,xz+z2,xyz-w2;
sortvars(i,0,xy,1,zw);
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=y
==>    _[2]=x
==>    _[3]=w
==>    _[4]=z
==> [2]:
==>    [1]:
==>       _[1]=y
==>       _[2]=x
==>    [2]:
==>       2,1
==>    [3]:
==>       2,3,
==>       1,1,
==>       2,0,
==>       0,2 
==>    [4]:
==>       1,1
==>    [5]:
==>       _[1]=w
==>       _[2]=z
==>    [6]:
==>       2,1
==>    [7]:
==>       2,2,
==>       2,1,
==>       0,2 
==>    [8]:
==>       1,1
