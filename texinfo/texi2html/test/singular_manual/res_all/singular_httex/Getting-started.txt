2.3 Getting started
===================

SINGULAR is a special purpose system for polynomial
computations. Hence, most of the powerful computations in SINGULAR
require the prior definition of a ring. Most important rings are
polynomial rings over a field, localizations hereof, or quotient rings of
such rings modulo an ideal. However, some simple computations with
integers (machine integers of limited size) and manipulations of strings
are available without a ring.
