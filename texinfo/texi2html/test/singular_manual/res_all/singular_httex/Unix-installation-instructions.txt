E.3 Unix installation instructions
==================================






To install SINGULAR on a
Unix
platform, you need the following two
archives:
Singular-2-0-4-share.tar.gz
contains architecture independent data like documentation and libraries
(alternatively, you may also download
Singular-2-0-4-share.zip).
Singular-2-0-4-<uname>.tar.gz
contains architecture dependent executables, like the SINGULAR
program.


<uname> is a description of the processor and operating system
for which SINGULAR is compiled (e.g, ix86-Linux). Please contact us if
you can not find an appropriate architecture dependent archive.

You can obtain these (and other) archives from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular>.


To install SINGULAR
===================

Make sure that you have approximately 12MByte of free disk space and follow
these steps.
1. Simply change to the directory in which you wish to install
SINGULAR (usually wherever you install 3rd-party software), for example:
cd /usr/local
or
mkdir install;cd install 
(you do not need root privileges in this case)

SINGULAR specific subdirectories will be created in such a way
that multiple versions and multiple architecture dependent files
of SINGULAR can peaceably coexist under the same /usr/local
tree.

2. Unpack the archives:
gzip -dc <path_to>/Singular-2-0-4-<uname>.tar.gz | tar -pxf -
gzip -dc <path_to>/Singular-2-0-4-share.tar.gz | tar -pxf -

This creates the the directory Singular/2-0-4 with 
 (sub)directories which contain
 <uname> Singular and ESingular executables
 LIB SINGULAR libraries (*.lib files)
 emacs files for the SINGULAR Emacs user interface
 info info files of SINGULAR manual
 html html files of SINGULAR manual
 doc miscellaneous documentation files
 examples SINGULAR examples (*.sing files)

For the executable to work, the directory layout must look pretty much
like this; the executable looks for "sibling" directories at run-time
to figure out where its SINGULAR libraries and on-line
documentation files are. These constraints on the local directory layout
are necessary to avoid having to hard-code pathnames into the
executables, or require that environment variables be set before
running the executable. In particular, you must not move or copy
the SINGULAR executables to another place, but use soft-links
instead.

The following steps are optional:

* Arrange that typing Singular at the shell prompt starts up the
installed SINGULAR executable.

If you have root permission, do:
ln -s `pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/Singular  /usr/local/bin/Singular-2-0-4
ln -s `pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/ESingular  /usr/local/bin/ESingular-2-0-4
ln -s /usr/local/bin/Singular-2-0-4 /usr/local/bin/Singular
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ESingular-2-0-4 /usr/local/bin/ESingular
	
Otherwise, append the directory
`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/ to your $PATH
environment variable. For the csh (or, tcsh) shell do:
set path=(`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname> $path)
For the bash (or, ksh) shell do:
export PATH=`pwd`/Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/:$PATH

You also might want to adjust your personal start-up files
(~/.cshrc for csh, ~/.tcshrc for tcsh, or
~/.profile for bash) accordingly,
so that the $PATH variable is set automatically each time you login.

IMPORTANT: Do never move or copy the file
Singular/2-0-4/<uname>/Singular to another
place, but use soft-links instead.

* If you wish to use any of following features of
SINGULAR, make sure that the respective programs are installed on your system:

 Feature Requires
 running ESingular, or Singular within Emacs Emacs <http://www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs.html> version
20 or higher, or, XEmacs <http://www.xemacs.org> version 20.3 or
higher (ESingular is only included in the Linux distribution,
on other Unix platforms you can download the
Singular emacs lisp files <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/src/> but we give no warranties for specific platforms).
 on-line html help netscape <http://www.netscape.com> browser
 on-line info help info <http://www.texinfo.org>, or
tkinfo <http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/tkinfo/> texinfo browser programs
 TAB completion and history mechanism of ASCII-terminal interface shared readline <ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/gnu/readline/>
library, i.e. /usr/lib/libreadline.so
 visualization of curves and surfaces surf <http://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/AlgebraischeGeometrie/surf/surf.shtml>
version 0.9 or higher (only available for Linux and Solaris).

You may download most of these programs from
<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils/>.

* Customize the on-line help system:

By default, on-line help is displayed in the html format using
the netscape program.

However, this behavior can be customized in several ways
using the SINGULAR commands system("--browser",<browser>)
and system("--allow-net", 1) (or, by starting up SINGULAR
with the respective command line options).

In particular, creating the file
Singular/2-0-4/LIB/.singularrc and putting the
SINGULAR command
system("--allow-net", 1);
in it, allows the on-line help system to fetch its html pages
from Singular's WWW home site <http://www.singular.uni-kl.de>
in case its local html pages are not found. That is, you may delete your
local html pages, after setting this option.

See also
The online help system, Command line options, and
Startup sequence,
for more details on customizing the on-line help system.

* Add the line
* Singular:(singular.hlp).     A system for polynomial computations
to your system-wide dir file (usually /usr/info/dir or
/usr/local/info/dir and  copy or soft-link the file
Singular/2-0-4/info/singular.hlp
to the directory of your dir file.

This assures that the
SINGULAR manual can be  accessed from stand-alone texinfo
browser programs such as info or Emacs.
(It is not necessary for the use of the help system from within Singular.)

Troubleshooting
===============

* General: SINGULAR can not find its libraries or on-line help
1. Make sure that you have read and/or execute permission the files and
directories of the Singular distribution. If in doubt, cd to the
directory where you unpacked SINGULAR, and do (as root, if
necessary):
chmod -R a+rX Singular

2. Start up SINGULAR, and issue the command system("Singular");.
If this does not return the correct and expanded location of the
SINGULAR executable, then you found a bug in SINGULAR, which we
ask you to report (see below).
3. Check whether the directories containing the libraries and on-line help
files can be found by SINGULAR: If $bindir denotes the
directory where the SINGULAR executable resides, then SINGULAR
looks for library files as follows:

 (0) the current directory

 (1) all dirs of the environment variable SINGULARPATH

 (2) $bindir/LIB

 (3) $bindir/../LIB

 (4) /usr/local/Singular/2-0-4/LIB

 (4) /usr/local/Singular/LIB

 The on-line info files need to be at  $bindir/../info and the
html pages at $bindir/../html.

You can inspect the found library and info/html
directories by starting up SINGULAR with the
--version option, or by issuing the SINGULAR command
system("--version");.

* Under SuSE-Linux, ESINGULAR does not display a prompt:
This is due to the very restrictive access rights of /dev/pty* of
the standard SuSE <http:/www.suse.de> distribution (starting from
version 6.3 on). As root, do one of the following: Either
chmod 666 /dev/pty*
or,
chmod g+s $(which emacs)
chgrp tty $(which emacs)
chmod g+s $(which xemacs)
chgrp tty $(which xemacs)
See also <http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/de/html/ke_devpts-63.html> for
details.

* For HPUX systems:

The /etc/termcap files which are pre-installed on these systems are
broken which leads to messages like
Name collision between 9826 9836
when SINGULAR is started. To fix this, you can get fixed termcap
files from <ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils>
by downloading the files termcap-<uname-description> and either
replace your /etc/termcap file by the file found there, or view, and
redo the respective changes by diff'ing the downloaded and the
original file.

* For ix86-Linux systems:

Due to some incompatibilities of shared libraries, the start-up of
SINGULAR might fail with messages like
  Can not find shared library ...
For DEBIAN systems, try to do
ln -s /usr/lib/libncurses.so /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4.

If this fails (and on other systems)
download and install
Singular-2-0-4-ix86-Linux-static.tar.gz.

* For AIX systems:

The default info program of the system is not GNU's texinfo
browser which is used to display the on-line documentation in the
info format. Therefore, the distribution of the AIX executable
already contains the info browser program.
If you remove this program, make sure that the GNU
info program is executed if you call 'info' from your shell.

* For any other troubles:

Please send an email to <mailto:singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
and include the header which is displayed by starting up SINGULAR
with the -v option, and a description of your machine (issue the
command uname -a on your shell) in your report.
