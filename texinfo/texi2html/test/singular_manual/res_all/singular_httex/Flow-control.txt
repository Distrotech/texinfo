3.5.6 Flow control
------------------

A block is a sequence of commands surrounded by { and }.
{
   command;
   ...
}
Blocks are used whenever SINGULAR is used as a structured programming
language. The if and else structures allow conditional
execution of blocks (see if, else). for and while
loops are available for repeated execution of blocks (see for,
while).
In procedure definitions the main part and the example section are blocks
as well(see proc).
* break::
* quit::
* keepring::
* export::
* if::
* else::
* for::
* while::
* proc::
* return::
* continue::
