3.9.2.1 lib2doc
...............


lib2doc is a utility to generate the stand-alone documentation for 
a SINGULAR library in various formats. 

The lib2doc utility should be used by developers of SINGULAR
libraries to check the generation of the documentation of their
libraries.

lib2doc can be downloaded from 

<ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/misc/lib2doc.tar.gz>


Important: 

To use lib2doc, you need 
to have perl (version 5 or
higher), texinfo (version 3.12 or higher)  and Singular
and libparse (version 1-3-4 or higher) installed on your system.

To generate the documentation for a library, follow these steps:
1. Unpack lib2doc.tar.gz
gzip -dc  lib2doc.tar.gz | tar -pxf -
and 
cd lib2doc

2. Edit the beginning of the file Makefile, filling in the values for
SINGULAR and LIBPARSE. Check also the values of PERL 
and LATEX2HTML.

3. Copy your library to the current directory:
cp <path-where-your-lib-is>/mylib.lib .

4. Now you can run the following commands:
make mylib.hlp
Generates the file mylib.hlp - the info file for the documentation
of mylib.lib. This file can be viewed with
info -f mylib.hlp
make mylib.dvi
Generates the file mylib.dvi - the dvi file for the documentation
of mylib.lib. This file can be viewed with
xdvi mylib.dvi
make mylib.ps
Generates the file mylib.ps - the PostScript file for the documentation
of mylib.lib. This file can be viewed with (for example)
ghostview mylib.dvi
make mylib.html
Generates the file mylib.html - the HTML file for the documentation
of mylib.lib. This file can be viewed with (for example)
netscape mylib.html
make clean
Deletes all generated files.


Note that you can safely ignore messages complaining about undefined
references.
