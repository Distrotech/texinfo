5.3.7 short
-----------
Type:
int
Purpose:
the output of monomials is done in the short manner,
if short is non-zero. A C-like notion is used, if short is zero.
Both notations may be used as input.

The default depends on the names of the ring variables
(0 if there are names of variables longer than 1 character, 1 otherwise). Every
change of the basering sets short to the previous value for
that ring. In other words, the value of the variable short is
"ring-local".
Example:
  ring r=23,x,dp;
  int save=short;
  short=1;
  2x2,x2;
==> 2x2 x2
  short=0;
  2x2,x2;
==> 2*x^2 x^2
  short=save;  //resets short to the previous value
