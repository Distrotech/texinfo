4.4 intmat
==========

Integer matrices are matrices with integer entries. For the range of
integers see Limitations. Integer matrices do not belong to a
ring, they may be defined without a basering being defined. An intmat
can be multiplied by and added to an int; in this case the int is
converted into an intmat of the right size with the integer on the
diagonal. The integer 1, for example, is converted into the unit
matrix.
