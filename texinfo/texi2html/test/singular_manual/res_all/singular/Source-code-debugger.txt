3.10.2 Source code debugger
---------------------------


The source code debugger (sdb) is an experimental feature, it's
interface may change in future versions of Singular.  
To enable the
use of the source code debugger SINGULAR has to be started with the
option -d or --sdb (see Command line options).


sdb commands
............
Each sdb command consist of one character which may be followed by
a parameter.
b
print backtrace of calling stack
c
continue
e
edit the current procedure and reload it (current call will be aborted)

 only available on UNIX systems
h,?
display help screen
n
execute current line, sdb break at next line
p <identifier>
display type and value of the variable given by <identifier>
Q
quit this Singular session
q <flags>
quit debugger, set debugger flags(0,1,2)

 0: continue, disable the debugger

 1: continue

 2: throw an error, return to toplevel


Syntactical errors in procedures
................................
If SINGULAR was started with the command line option -d or
--sdb a syntactical error in a procedure will start the
source code debugger instead of returning to the top level with an
error message. The commands q 1 and q 2 are equivalent in this
case.

SDB breakpoints in procedures
.............................
Up to seven SDB breakpoints can be set.
To set a breakpoint at a procedure use
breakpoint. (See breakpoint).

These breakpoints can be cleared with the command d breakpoint_no
from within the debugger or with
breakpoint( proc_name ,-1);.
