3.2.3 Demo mode
---------------

The Emacs interface can be used to run interactive SINGULAR
demonstrations. A demonstration is started by loading a so-called
SINGULAR demo file with the Emacs command
singular-demo-load, bound to
C-c C-d, or with the menu Commands->Load Demo.

A SINGULAR demo file should consist of SINGULAR commands
separated by blank lines. When running a demo, the input up to the next
blank line is echoed to the screen. Hitting <RETURN> executes the
echoed commands and shows their output. Hitting <RETURN> again,
echos the next commands to the screen, and so on, until all commands of
the demo file are executed. While running a demo, you can
execute other commands on the SINGULAR prompt: the next input of
from the demo file is then echoed again, if you hit <RETURN> on
an empty input line.

A SINGULAR demo can prematurely be exited by either starting
another demo, or by executing the Emacs command
singular-demo-exit (menu: Commands->Exit Demo).

Some aspects of running SINGULAR demos can be customized.
See Customization of the Emacs interface, for more info.
