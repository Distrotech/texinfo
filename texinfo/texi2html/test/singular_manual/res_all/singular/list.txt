4.7 list
========

Lists are arrays whose elements can be of any type (including ring and
qring). If one element belongs to a ring the whole list belongs to that
ring. This applies also to the special list #. The expression
list() is the empty list.

Note that a list stores the objects itself and not the names.  Hence, if
L is a list, L[1] for example has no name.  A name, say
R, can be created for L[1] by def R=L[1];. To store
also the name of an object, say r, it can be added to the list
with nameof(r);. Rings and qrings may be objects of a list.

Note: Unlike other assignments a ring as an element of a list
is not a copy but another reference to the same ring.
