5.1.71 memory
-------------
Syntax:
memory ( int_expression )
Type:
int
Purpose:
returns statistics concerning the memory management:
* memory(0) is the number of active (used) bytes,
* memory(1) is the number of bytes allocated from the
operating system,
* memory(2) is the maximal number of bytes ever allocated from the
operating system during the current SINGULAR session.
Note:
To monitor the memory usage during ongoing computations the option
mem should be set (using the command option(mem);, see
also option).
Example:
  ring r=0,(x(1..500)),dp;
  poly p=(x(1)+x(500))^50;
  proc ReportMemoryUsage()
  {  "Memory currently used by SINGULAR     :",memory(0),"Byte (",
     memory(0)/1023, "KByte)" +newline+
     "Memory currently allocated from system:",memory(1), "Byte (",
     memory(1)/1023, "KByte)";
     "Maximal memory allocated from system  :",memory(2), "Byte (",
     memory(2)/1023, "KByte)";
  }
  ReportMemoryUsage();
==> Memory currently used by SINGULAR     : 206940 Byte ( 202 KByte)
==> Memory currently allocated from system: 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
==> Maximal memory allocated from system  : 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
  kill p;
  ReportMemoryUsage(); // less memory used: p killed
==> Memory currently used by SINGULAR     : 153704 Byte ( 150 KByte)
==> Memory currently allocated from system: 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
==> Maximal memory allocated from system  : 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
  kill r;
  ReportMemoryUsage(); // even less memory: r killed
==> Memory currently used by SINGULAR     : 143124 Byte ( 139 KByte)
==> Memory currently allocated from system: 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
==> Maximal memory allocated from system  : 669128 Byte ( 654 KByte)
