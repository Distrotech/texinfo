4.18 vector
===========

Vectors are elements of a free module over the basering with basis
gen(1), gen(2), ... .
Each vector belongs to a free module of rank equal to the biggest index
of a generator with non-zero coefficient. Since generators with zero
coefficients need not be written any vector may be considered
also as an element of a free module of higher rank.
Like polynomials they
can only be defined or accessed with respect to the basering.
(E.g., if f and g are polynomials then
f*gen(1)+g*gen(3)+gen(4) may also be written as [f,0,g,1]
or as [f,0,g,1,0].) Note that the elements of a vector have to be
surrounded by square brackets ([  , ])
(cf. Representation of mathematical objects).
