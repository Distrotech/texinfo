=========

Polynomials are the basic data for all main algorithms in
SINGULAR. They consist of finitely many terms
(coefficient*power product) which are combined by the usual polynomial
operations (see poly expressions). Polynomials can only be defined
or accessed with respect to a basering which determines the coefficient
type, the names of the indeterminates and the monomial ordering.
