5.2.6 for
---------
Syntax:
for ( init_command;
boolean_expression;
iterate_commands) block
Purpose:
repetitive, conditional execution of a command block.

The command init_command is executed first. Then boolean_expression is
evaluated. If its value is TRUE the block is executed, otherwise the
for statement is complete. After each execution of the block, the
command iterate_command is executed and boolean_expression is
evaluated. This is repeated until boolean_expression evaluates to FALSE.

The command break; leaves the innermost for construct.
Example:
// sum of 1 to 10:
int s=0;
for (int i=1; i<=10; i=i+1)
{
   s=s+i;
}
s;
==> 55
