3.7 Procedures
==============

Procedures contain sequences of commands of the SINGULAR language.
They are used to extend
the set of commands with user defined commands.  Procedures are defined
by either typing them on the command line or by loading them from a
so-called library file with the LIB command, see LIB.  Procedures are
invoked like normal built-in commands, i.e., by typing their name
followed by the list of arguments in parentheses. The invocation then
executes the sequence of commands stored in the specified procedure. All
defined procedures can be displayed by the command listvar(proc);.
