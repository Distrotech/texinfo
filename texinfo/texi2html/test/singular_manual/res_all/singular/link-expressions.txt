4.6.2 link expressions
----------------------

A link expression is:
1. an identifier of type link
2. a string describing the link

A link is described by a string which consists of two parts: a property
string followed by a name string. The property string describes the type
of the link (ASCII, MPfile, MPtcp or DBM)
and the mode of the link (e.g., open for read, write or append). The name
string describes the filename of the link, resp. a network connection
for MPtcp links.
