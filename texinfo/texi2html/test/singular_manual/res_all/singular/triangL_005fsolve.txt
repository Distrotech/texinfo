D.7.2.11 triangL_solve
......................
Procedure from library solve.lib (see solve_lib).

Usage:
triangL_solve(i [, p] ); i=ideal, p=integer,

p>0: gives precision of complex numbers in digits (default: p=30).

Assume:
the ground field has char 0; i is a zero-dimensional ideal.

Return:
nothing

Create:
The procedure creates a ring rC with the same number of variables but
with complex coefficients (and precision p).

In rC a list rlist of numbers is created, in which the complex
roots of i are stored.

The proc uses a triangular system (Lazard's Algorithm) computed from
a standard basis to determine recursively all complex roots with
Laguerre's algorithm of input ideal i.

Example:
LIB "solve.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y),lp;
// compute the intersection points of two curves
ideal s=  x2 + y2 - 10, x2 + xy + 2y2 - 16;
triangL_solve(s,10);
==> // name of new ring: rC
==> // list of roots: rlist
rlist;
