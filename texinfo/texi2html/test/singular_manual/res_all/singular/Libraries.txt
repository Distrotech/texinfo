3.8 Libraries
=============

A library is a collection of SINGULAR
procedures in a file.

SINGULAR reads a library with the command
LIB. General information about the library is displayed by the command
help libname_lib. After loading the library, its procedures can be used
like the built-in SINGULAR functions.

To have the full functionality of a built-in function libraries have to
comply with the few syntax rules described below.

Furthermore, libraries which are to be included in the SINGULAR
distribution, have to comply with certain rules as explained in
Guidelines for writing a library.
