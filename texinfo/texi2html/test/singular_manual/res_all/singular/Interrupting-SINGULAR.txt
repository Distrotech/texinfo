3.1.4 Interrupting SINGULAR
---------------------------

On Unix-like operating systems and on Windows NT, typing CTRL-C
(or, alternatively C-c C-c, when running within Emacs),
interrupts SINGULAR.  SINGULAR prints the current command and
the current line and prompts for further action.  The following choices
are available:
a
returns to the top level after finishing the current (kernel) command. Notice
that commands of the SINGULAR kernel (like std) can not be
aborted, i.e. (a)bort only happens whenever the interpreter is active.
c
continues
q
quits  SINGULAR
