4.13 proc
=========

Procedures are sequences of SINGULAR commands in a special
format. They are used to extend the set of SINGULAR commands with
user defined commands. Once a procedure is defined it can be used as
any other SINGULAR command. Procedures may be defined by either
typing them on the command line or by loading them from a file. For a
detailed description on the concept of procedures in SINGULAR see
Procedures. A file containing procedure definitions which comply with
certain syntax rules is called a library. Such a file is loaded
using the command LIB. For more information on libraries see
Libraries.
