3.1.2 The SINGULAR prompt
-------------------------
The SINGULAR prompt > (larger than) asks the user for input
of commands.  The "continuation" prompt . (period) asks the
user for input of missing parts of a command (remember the semicolon at
the end of every command).

SINGULAR does not interpret the semicolon as the end of a command
if it occurs inside a string.  Also, SINGULAR waits for blocks
(sequences of commands enclosed in curly brackets) to be closed before
prompting with > for more commands.  Thus, if SINGULAR does
not respond with its regular prompt after typing a semicolon it may wait
for a " or a } first.

Additional semicolons will not harm SINGULAR since they are
interpreted as empty statements.
