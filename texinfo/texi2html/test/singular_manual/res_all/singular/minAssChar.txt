D.4.7.5 minAssChar
..................
Procedure from library primdec.lib (see primdec_lib).

Usage:
minAssChar(i[,c]); i ideal, c int.

Return:
list, the minimal associated prime ideals of i.

Note:
If c=0, the given ordering of the variables is used. 

Otherwise, the system tries to find an optimal ordering,
which in some cases may considerably speed up the algorithm. 

Due to a bug in the factorization, the result may be not completely
decomposed in small characteristic.

Example:
LIB "primdec.lib";
ring  r = 0,(x,y,z),dp;
poly  p = z2+1;
poly  q = z3+2;
ideal i = p*q^2,y-z2;
list pr = minAssChar(i);
pr;
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=y+1
==>    _[2]=z2+1
==> [2]:
==>    _[1]=z2-y
==>    _[2]=yz+2
==>    _[3]=y2+2z
