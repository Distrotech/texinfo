3.1.3 The online help system
----------------------------

The online help system is invoked with the help command.
? may be used as a synonym for help.  Simply typing
help; displays the "top" of the help system (i.e., the title
page of the SINGULAR manual) which offers a
short table of contents.  Typing help topic; shows the
available documentation on topic.  Here, topic may be either a function
name or, more generally, any index entry of the SINGULAR
manual. Furthermore, topic may contain wildcard characters.
See help, for more information.

Online help information can be displayed in various help browsers. The
following table lists a summary of the supported browsers. See below for
more details about particular browsers.

 Browser Platform Description
 html Windows displays html version of manual in your default html browser
 winhlp Windows displays Windows help (.hlp) version of manual
 netscape Unix, Windows uses netscape to display html version of manual
 tkinfo Unix uses the tkinfo program to display texinfo version of manual
 xinfo Unix, Windows uses the info program to display texinfo version of manual in an
extra xterm
 info Unix, Windows uses the info program to display texinfo version of manual
 builtin all simply outputs the help information in plain ASCII format
 emacs Unix, Windows when running SINGULAR within (X)emacs, display help in
(X)emacs info buffer.
 dummy all displays error message about no available help browser

The browser which is used to display the help information, can be either
set at startup time with the command line option  (see Command line options)
--brower=<browser>
or with the SINGULAR command (see system)
system("--browser", <browser>);
The  SINGULAR command
system("browsers");
lists all available browsers and the command
system("--browser");
returns the currently used browser.

If no browser is explicitly set by the user, then the first (w.r.t. the
order of the browsers in the table above) available browser is
chosen. In other words, the default browser is netscape for Unix
platforms, and html for Windows, unless
your local set-up does not allow to run it.

The .singularrc (see Startup sequence) file is a good place
to set your default browser. Recall that if a file
$HOME/.singularrc exists on your system, then the content of this
file is executed before the first user input. Hence, putting
if (system("version") >= 1306) // keep backwards-compatibility
{
  if (! system("--emacs")
  {
    // only set help browser if not running within emacs
    system("--browser", "info");
  }
  // if help browser is later on set to netscape,
  // allow it to fetch HTML pages from the net
  system("--allow-net", 1);
}; // the last semicolon is important: otherwise no ">", but "." prompt
in your file $HOME/.singularrc sets your default browser to
info, unless SINGULAR is run within emacs (in which case the
default browser is set automatically to emacs).


Obviously, certain external files and programs are required for the
SINGULAR help system to work correctly. If something is not available
or goes wrong, here are some tips for troubleshooting the help system:

* Under Unix, the environment variable DISPLAY has to be set for
the browsers netscape, tkinfo, and xinfo to work.

* The help browsers netscape, tkinfo, xinfo, and
info are only available if the respective programs are installed
on your system (for xinfo, the programs xterm and
info are necessary). You can explicitly specify which program to
use, by setting appropriate environment variables (whose names
are the names of the respective programs in all up-case letters).

For example,
to use the program navigator with a private colormap as
netscape help browser, set the environment variable
NETSCAPE to the value
"navigator -install".

* If the help browser netscape can not find the local html
pages of the SINGULAR manual (which it looks for at
$RootDir/html - see Loading of a library for more info on
$RootDir) and the (command-line) option --allow-net
has explicitly been set (see Command line options and
system for more info on
setting values of command-line options), then it dispatches the html
pages from
<http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual> (note that
the non-local net-access of HTML pages is disabled, by default).

An
alternative location of a local directory where the html pages reside
can be specified by setting the environment variable
SINGULAR_HTML_DIR.

* The help browsers tkinfo, xinfo, info, and
builtin need the (info) file singular.hlp which it looks
for at $RootDir/info/singular.hlp (see Loading of a library
for more info on $RootDir).  An alternative
location of the info file of the manual can be specified by setting the
environment variable SINGULAR_INFO_FILE.

Info help browsers
..................

The help browsers tkinfo, xinfo and info (so-called
info help browsers) are based on the
info program from the Gnu texinfo package.  See Getting started in The Info Manual, for more
information.

For info help browsers, the online manual is decomposed into "nodes"
of information, closely
related to the division of the printed manual into sections and
subsections.  A node contains text describing a specific topic at a
specific level of detail.  The top line of a node is its "header".
The node's header tells the name of the current node (Node:), the
name of the next node (Next:), the name of the previous node
(Prev:), and the name of the upper node (Up:).

To move within info, type commands consisting of single characters.  Do
not type RETURN.  Do not use cursor keys, either.  Using some of
the cursor keys by accident might pop to some totally different node.
Type l to return to the original node.  Some of the info
commands read input from the command line at the bottom line.  The
TAB key may be used to complete partially entered input.

The most important commands are:
q
leaves the online help system
n
goes to the next node
p
goes to the previous node
u
goes to the upper node
m
picks a menu item specified by name
f
follows a cross reference
l
goes to the previously visited node
b
goes to the beginning of the current node
e
goes to the end of the current node
SPACE
scrolls forward a page
DEL
scrolls backward a page
h
invokes info tutorial (use l to return to the manual or
CTRL-X 0 to remove extra window)
CTRL-H
shows a short overview on the online help system (use l to return
to the manual or CTRL-X 0 to remove extra window)
s
searches through the manual for a specified string, and selects the node in
which the next occurrence is found
1, ..., 9
picks i-th subtopic from a menu
