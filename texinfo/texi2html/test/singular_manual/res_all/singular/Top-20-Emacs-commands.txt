3.2.6 Top 20 Emacs commands
---------------------------

Here is a list of the 20 probably most useful commands when using the
SINGULAR Emacs interface.

Starting and stopping of SINGULAR:

* singular (menu Singular->Start Default...): starts
SINGULAR using default arguments.

* singular-other (menu Singular->Start): starts
SINGULAR asking for several arguments in the minibuffer area.

* singular-exit (key C-c $ or menu
Singular->Exit): kills the SINGULAR process running in the
current buffer (but does not kill the buffer).

* singular-restart (key C-c C-r or menu
Singular->Restart): kills the SINGULAR process running in
the current buffer and starts a new SINGULAR process with exactly
the same arguments as before.


Editing input and output:

* singular-beginning-of-line (key C-a): moves point to
beginning of line, then skip past the SINGULAR prompt, if any.

* singular-toggle-truncate-lines (key C-c C-t or menu
Commands->Truncate lines): toggles whether long lines should be
truncated or not. If lines are not truncated, the commands
singular-scroll-left and singular-scroll-right are useful
to scroll left and right, resp.

* singular-dynamic-complete (key TAB): performs
context specific completion. If point is inside a string, file name
completion is done. If point is at the end of a help command (i.e.,
help or ?), completion on SINGULAR help topics is
done. If point is at the end of an example command (i.e.,
example), completion is done on SINGULAR examples. In all
other cases, completion on SINGULAR commands is done.

* singular-folding-toggle-fold-latest-output (key C-c
C-o or menu Commands->Fold/ Unfold Latest Output): toggles
folding of the latest output section. If your last SINGULAR command
produced a huge output, simply type C-c C-o and it will be
replaced by a single line.

* singular-folding-toggle-fold-at-point (key C-c C-f
or menu Commands->Fold/Unfold At Point): toggles folding of the
section the point currently is in.

* singular-folding-fold-all-output (menu Commands->Fold
All Output): folds all SINGULAR output, replacing each output
section by a single line.

* singular-folding-unfold-all-output (menu
Commands->Unfold All Output): unfolds all SINGULAR output
sections showing their true contents.


Loading of files and SINGULAR demo mode:

* singular-load-library (key C-c C-l or menu
Commands->Libraries->other...): asks for a standard library name
or a library file in the minibuffer (hit TAB for completion) and
loads the library into SINGULAR. The submenu Libraries of
the Commands menu also provides a separate menu item for each
standard library.

* singular-load-file (key C-c < or menu
Commands->Load File...): asks for a file name in the minibuffer
(which is expanded using expand-file-name if given a prefix
argument) and loads the file into SINGULAR.

* singular-demo-load (key C-c C-d or menu
Commands->Load Demo...): asks for a file name of a SINGULAR
demo file in the minibuffer area (hit SPACE for completion) and
enters the SINGULAR demo mode showing the first chunk of the demo.

* singular-demo-exit (menu Commands->Exit Demo):
exits from SINGULAR demo mode and cleans up everything that is
left from the demo.


Help and Customization:

* singular-help (key C-h C-s or menu
Singular->Singular Help): asks for a SINGULAR help topic in
the minibuffer (hit TAB for completion) and shows the help text
in a separate buffer.

* singular-example (key C-c C-e or menu
Singular->Singular Example): asks for a SINGULAR command in
the minibuffer (hit TAB for completion) and executes the example
of this command in the current SINGULAR buffer.

* customize-group (menu Singular->Preferences): enters
the customization group of the SINGULAR Emacs interface. (If called
via M-x customize-group give argument singular-interactive
in the minibuffer area.)
