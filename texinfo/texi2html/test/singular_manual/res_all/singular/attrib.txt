5.1.1 attrib
------------
Syntax:
attrib ( name )
Type:
none
Purpose:
displays the attribute list of the object called name.
Example:
  ring r=0,(x,y,z),dp;
  ideal I=std(maxideal(2));
  attrib(I);
==> attr:isSB, type int
Syntax:
attrib ( name , string_expression )
Type:
any
Purpose:
returns the value of the attribute string_expression of the
variable name. If the attribute is not defined for this variable,
attrib returns the empty string.
Example:
  ring r=0,(x,y,z),dp;
  ideal I=std(maxideal(2));
  attrib(I,"isSB");
==> 1
  // although maxideal(2) is a standard basis,
  // SINGULAR does not know it:
  attrib(maxideal(2), "isSB");
==> 0
Syntax:
attrib ( name, string_expression, expression )
Type:
none
Purpose:
sets the attribute string_expression of the variable name
to the value expression.
Example:
  ring r=0,(x,y,z),dp;
  ideal I=maxideal(2); // the attribute "isSB" is not set
  vdim(I);
==> // ** I is no standardbasis
==> 4
  attrib(I,"isSB",1);  // the standard basis attribute is set here
  vdim(I);
==> 4
Remark:
An attribute may be described by any string_expression. Some of these are
used by the kernel of SINGULAR and referred to as reserved attributes.
Non-reserved attributes may be used, however, in procedures and can
considerably speed up computations.

Reserved attributes:
(not all are in use at the moment)
isSB
the standard basis property is set by all commands computing a standard
basis like
groebner, std, stdhilb etc.; used by lift, dim,
degree, mult, hilb, vdim, kbase
isHomog
the weight vector for homogeneous or quasihomogeneous ideals/modules
isCI
complete intersection property
isCM
Cohen-Macaulay property
rank
set the rank of a module (see nrows)
withSB
value of type ideal, resp. module, is std
withHilb
value of type intvec is hilb(_,1) (see hilb)
withRes
value of type list is a free resolution
withDim
value of type int is the dimension (see dim)
withMult
value of type int is the multiplicity (see mult)
