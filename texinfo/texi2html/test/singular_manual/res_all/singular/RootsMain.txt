D.7.5.13 RootsMain
..................
Procedure from library zeroset.lib (see zeroset_lib).

Usage:
RootsMain(f); where f is a polynomial

Purpose:
compute all roots of f in a finite extension of the ground field
without multiplicities.

Return:
list, all entries are polynomials
    _[1] = roots of f, each entry is a polynomial
  _[2] = 'newA' - if the ground field is Q(a') and the extension field
         is Q(a), then 'newA' is the representation of a' in Q(a)
  _[3] = minpoly of the algebraic extension of the ground field
  

Assume:
basering = Q[x,a] ideal mpoly must be defined, it might be 0!

Note:
might change the ideal mpoly !!
