4.16.1 ring declarations
------------------------

Syntax:
ring name = ( coefficient_field ),
  ( names_of_ring_variables ),
  ( ordering );
Default:
32003,(x,y,z),(dp,C);
Purpose:
declares a ring and sets it as the actual basering.

The coefficient_field is given by one of the following:
1. a non-negative int_expression less or equal 2147483629.
2. an expression_list of an int_expression and one or more names.
3. the name real
4. an expression_list of the name real and an  int_expression.
5. an expression_list of the name complex, an optional int_expression
and a name.

For the definition of the 'coefficient_field', see Rings and orderings.

'names_of_ring_variables' must be a list of names or indexed names.

'ordering' is a list of block orderings where each block ordering is either
1. lp, dp, Dp, ls, ds, or Ds
optionally followed by a size parameter in parentheses.

2. wp, Wp, ws, Ws, or a followed by a
weight vector given as an intvec_expression in parentheses.

3. M followed by an intmat_expression in parentheses.

4. c or C.

For the definition of the orderings, see Term orderings,
Monomial orderings.

If one of coefficient_field, names_of_ring_variables, and ordering
consists of only one entry, the parentheses around this entry may be
omitted.
