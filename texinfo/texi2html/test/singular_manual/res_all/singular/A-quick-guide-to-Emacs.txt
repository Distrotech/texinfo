3.2.1 A quick guide to Emacs
----------------------------

This section gives a tutorial-like introduction to Emacs. Especially to
users who are not familiar with Emacs, we recommend that they go through
this section and try out the described features.

Emacs commands generally involve the CONTROL key (sometimes
labeled CTRL or CTL) or the META key.  On some
keyboards, the META key is labeled ALT or EDIT or
something else (for example, on Sun keyboards, the diamond key to the
left of the space-bar is META).  If there is no META key,
the ESC key can be used, instead.  Rather than writing out
META or
CONTROL each time we want to prefix a character, we will use the
following abbreviations:

 C-<chr> means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character
<chr>. Thus, C-f would be: hold the CONTROL key and
type f.
 M-<chr> means hold the META key down while typing <chr>.  If there
is no META key, type <ESC>, release it, then type the
character <chr>.

For user new to Emacs, we highly recommend that they go through the
interactive Emacs tutorial: type C-h t to start it.

For others, it is important to understand the following Emacs concepts:
window
In Emacs terminology, a window refers to separate panes within the same
window of the window system, and not to overlapping, separate
windows. When using SINGULAR within Emacs, extra windows may appear
which display help or output from certain commands. The most important
window commands are:
 C-x 1 File->Un-Split Un-Split window (i.e., kill other windows)
 C-x o  Goto other window, i.e. move cursor into other window.

cursor and point
The location of the cursor in the text is also called "point".  To
paraphrase, the cursor shows on the screen where point is located in
the text. Here is a summary of simple cursor-moving operations:
 C-f Move forward a character
 C-b Move backward a character
 M-f Move forward a word
 M-b Move backward a word
 C-a Move to the beginning of line
 C-e Move to the end of line

buffer
Any text you see in an Emacs window is always part of some buffer. For
example, each file you are editing with Emacs is stored inside a buffer,
but also SINGULAR is running inside an Emacs buffer. Each buffer
has a name: for example, the buffer of a file you edit usually has the
same name as the file, SINGULAR is running in a buffer which has
the name *singular* (or, *singular<2>*,
*singular<3>*, etc., if you have multiple SINGULAR
sessions within the same Emacs).

When you are asked for input to an Emacs command, the cursor
moves to the bottom line of Emacs, i.e., to a special buffer, called the
"minibuffer". Typing <RETURN> within the minibuffer, ends the
input, typing <SPACE> within the minibuffer, lists all possible
input values to the interactive Emacs command.

The most important buffer commands are
 C-x b Switch buffer
 C-x k Kill current buffer
Alternatively, you can switch to or kill buffers using the Buffer
menu.

Executing commands
Emacs commands are executed by typing M-x <command-name>
(remember that <SPACE> completes partial
command names). Important and frequently used commands have short-cuts
for their execution: Key bindings or even menu entries. For example, a
file can be loaded with M-x load-file, or C-x C-f, or with
the File->Open menu.

How to exit
To end the Emacs (and, SINGULAR) session,
type C-x C-c (two characters), or use the File -> Exit
menu.

When Emacs is hung
If Emacs stops responding to your commands, you can stop it safely by
typing C-g, or, if this fails, by typing C-].

More help
Nearly all aspects of Emacs are very well documented: type
C-h  and then a character saying what kind of help you want.
For example, typing C-h i enters the Info documentation
browser.

Using the mouse
Emacs is fully integrated with the mouse. In particular, clicking the
right mouse button brings up a pop-up menu which usually contains a few
commonly used commands.
