5.2.12 ~ (break point)
----------------------
Syntax:
~;
Purpose:
sets a break point. Whenever SINGULAR reaches the command ~;
in a sequence of commands it prompts for input. The user may now input
lines of SINGULAR commands. The line length cannot exceed 80
characters.
SINGULAR proceeds with the execution of the command following ~;
as soon as it receives an empty line.
Example:
proc t
{
  int i=2;
  ~;
  return(i+1);
}
t();
==> -- break point in t --
==> -- 0: called    from STDIN --
// here local variables of the procedure can be accessed
i;
==> 2
==> -- break point in t --

==> 3
