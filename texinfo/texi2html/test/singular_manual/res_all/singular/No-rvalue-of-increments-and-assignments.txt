6.2.1 No rvalue of increments and assignments
---------------------------------------------

The increment operator ++ (resp. decrement operator --)
has no rvalue, i.e., cannot be used on the right-hand sides of
assignments.  So, instead of

j = i++;  // WRONG!!!

(which results in an error), it must be written

i++; j = i;

Likewise, an assignment expression does not have a result.  Therefore,
compound assignments like i = j = k; are not allowed and result
in an error.
