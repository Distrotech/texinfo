3.1.1 How to enter and exit
---------------------------

SINGULAR can either be run in ASCII-terminal or within Emacs.

To start SINGULAR in its ASCII-terminal user interface,  enter
Singular at the system prompt. The
SINGULAR banner appears which, among others, reports the version
and the compilation date.

To start SINGULAR in its Emacs user interface, either enter
ESingular at the system prompt, or type M-x singular
within a running Emacs (provided you have loaded the file
singular.el in your running Emacs, see Running SINGULAR under Emacs for details).

Generally, we recommend to use SINGULAR in its Emacs interface,
since this offers many more features and is more convenient to
use than the ASCII-terminal interface (see Emacs user interface).

To exit SINGULAR type quit;, exit; or $ (or,
when running within Emacs preferably type C-c $).

SINGULAR and ESingular may also be started with command line
options and with
filenames as arguments. More generally, the synopsis of SINGULAR is
Singular  [options] [file1 [file2 ...]]
ESingular  [options] [file1 [file2 ...]]

See Command line options, Startup sequence, Running SINGULAR under Emacs.
