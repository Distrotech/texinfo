A.11 Free resolution
====================

In SINGULAR a free resolution of a module or ideal has its own type:
resolution. It is a structure that stores all information related to
free resolutions. This allows partial computations of resolutions via
the command res. After applying res, only a pre-format of the
resolution is computed which allows to determine invariants like
Betti-numbers or homological dimension. To see the differentials
of the complex, a resolution must be converted into the type list which
yields a list of modules: the k-th module in this
list is the first syzygy-module (module of relations) of the (k-1)st module.
There are the following commands to compute a resolution:
res
res

computes a free resolution of an ideal or module using a heuristically
chosen method.
This is the preferred method to compute free resolutions of ideals or
modules.
lres
lres

computes a free resolution of an ideal or module with La Scala's
method. The input needs to be homogeneous.
mres
mres

computes a minimal free resolution of an ideal or module with the syzygy
method.
sres
sres

computes a free resolution of an ideal or module with Schreyer's
method. The input has to be a standard basis.
nres
nres

computes a free resolution of an ideal or module with the standard basis
method.
minres
minres

minimizes a free resolution of an ideal or module.
syz
syz

computes the first syzygy module.
res(i,r), lres(i,r), sres(i,r), mres(i,r),
nres(i,r) compute the first r modules of the resolution
of i, resp. the full resolution if r=0 and the basering is not a qring.
See the manual for a precise description of these commands.

Note: The command betti does not require a minimal
resolution for the minimal betti numbers.

Now let's look at an example which uses resolutions: The Hilbert-Burch
theorem says that the ideal i of a reduced curve in
$K^3$
has a free resolution of length 2 and that i is given by the 2x2 minors
of the 2nd matrix in the resolution.
We test this for two transversal cusps in
$K^3$.
Afterwards we compute the resolution of the ideal j of the tangent developable
of the rational normal curve in
$P^4$
from above.
Finally we demonstrate the use of the type resolution in connection with
the lres command.

  // Two transversal cusps in (k^3,0):
  ring r2 =0,(x,y,z),ds;
  ideal i =z2-1y3+x3y,xz,-1xy2+x4,x3z;
  resolution rs=mres(i,0);   // computes a minimal resolution
  rs;                        // the standard representation of complexes
==>   1       3       2       
==> r2 <--  r2 <--  r2

==> 
    list resi=rs;            // convertion to a list
  print(resi[1]);            // the 1st module is i minimized
==> xz,
==> z2-y3+x3y,
==> xy2-x4
  print(resi[2]);            // the 1st syzygy module of i
==> -z,-y2+x3,
==> x, 0,     
==> y, z      
  resi[3];                   // the 2nd syzygy module of i
==> _[1]=0
  ideal j=minor(resi[2],2);
  reduce(j,std(i));          // check whether j is contained in i
==> _[1]=0
==> _[2]=0
==> _[3]=0
  size(reduce(i,std(j)));    // check whether i is contained in j
==> 0
  // size(<ideal>) counts the non-zero generators
