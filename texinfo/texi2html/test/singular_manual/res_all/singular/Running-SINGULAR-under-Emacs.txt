3.2.2 Running SINGULAR under Emacs
----------------------------------

There are two ways to start the SINGULAR Emacs interface: Typing
ESingular instead of Singular on the command shell
launches a new Emacs process, initializes the interface and runs
SINGULAR within Emacs. The other way is to start the interface in
an already running Emacs, by typing M-x singular inside
Emacs. This initializes the interface and runs SINGULAR within
Emacs. Both ways are described in more detail below.

Note: To properly run the Emacs interface, several files are needed
which usually reside in the emacs subdirectory of your
SINGULAR distribution. This directory is called
singular-emacs-home-directory in the following.

Starting the interface using ESingular
--------------------------------------

As mentioned above, ESingular is an "out-of-the-box" solution:
You don't have to add special things to your .emacs startup file
to initialize the interface; everything is done for you in a special
file called .emacs-singular (which comes along with the
SINGULAR distribution and resides in the
singular-emacs-home-directory) which is automatically loaded on Emacs
startup (and the loading of the .emacs file is automatically
suppressed).

The customizable variables of the SINGULAR Emacs interface are set
to defaults which give the novice user a very shell like
feeling of the interface. Nevertheless, these default settings can be
changed, see Customization of the Emacs interface. Besides other
Emacs initializations, such as fontification or blinking parentheses, a
new menu item called Singular is added to the main menu,
providing menu items for starting SINGULAR. On XEmacs, a button
starting SINGULAR is added to the main toolbar.

The SINGULAR interface is started automatically; once you see a
buffer called *singular* and the SINGULAR prompt you are
ready to start your SINGULAR session.

ESingular inherits all Singular options. For a description
off all these options, see Command line options. Additionally
there are the following options which are special to ESingular:

 command-line option /

environment variable functionality
 --emacs=EMACS

ESINGULAR_EMACS Use EMACS as Emacs program to run the SINGULAR Emacs
interface, where EMACS may e.g. be emacs or xemacs.
 --emacs-dir=DIR

ESINGULAR_EMACS_DIR Set the singular-emacs-home-directory, which is the directory where
singular.el can be found,  to DIR.
 --emacs-load=FILE

ESINGULAR_EMACS_LOAD Load FILE on Emacs start-up, instead of the default load file.
 --singular=PROG

ESINGULAR_SINGULAR Start PROG as SINGULAR program within Emacs

Notice that values of these options can also be given by setting the
above mentioned environment variables (where values  given as
command-line arguments take priority over values given by environment
variables).

Starting the interface within a running Emacs
---------------------------------------------

If you are a more experienced Emacs user and you already have your own
local .emacs startup file, you might want to start the interface
out of your running Emacs without using ESingular. For this, you
should add the following lisp code to your .emacs file:

(setq load-path (cons "<singular-emacs-home-directory>" load-path))
(autoload 'singular "singular"
  "Start Singular using default values." t)
(autoload 'singular-other "singular"
  "Ask for arguments and start Singular." t)

Then typing M-x singular in a running Emacs session initializes
the interface in a new buffer and launches a SINGULAR process. The
SINGULAR prompt comes up and you are ready to start your
SINGULAR session.

It is a good idea to take a look at the (well documented) file
.emacs-singular in the singular-emacs-home-directory, which comes
along with the distribution. In it you find some useful initializations
of the SINGULAR interface as well as some lisp code, which, for
example, adds a button to the XEmacs toolbar. Some of this code might be
useful for your .emacs file, too. And if you are a Emacs wizard,
it is of course a good idea to take a look at singular.el in the
singular-emacs-home-directory.

Starting, interrupting and stopping SINGULAR
--------------------------------------------

There are the following commands to start and stop SINGULAR:

* singular-other (or menu Singular, item
Start...)

Starts a SINGULAR process and asks for the following four
parameters in the minibuffer area:

1. The Singular executable. This can either be a file name with complete
path, e.g., /local/bin/Singular. Then exactly this executable is
started. The path may contain the character ~ denoting your home
directory. Or it can be the name of a command without path, e.g.,
Singular. Then the executable is searched for in your
$PATH environment variable.

2. The default working directory. This is the path to an existing
directory, e.g., ~/work. The current directory is set to this
directory before SINGULAR is started.

3. Command line options. You can set any SINGULAR command line
option (see Command line options).

4. The buffer name. You can specify the name of the buffer the interface is
running in.


* singular (or menu Singular, item Start
default)

Starts SINGULAR with default settings for the executable, the
working directory, command line switches, and the buffer name. You can
customize this default settings, see
Customization of the Emacs interface.

* singular-exit-singular (bound to C-c $ or menu
Singular, item Exit)

Kills the running SINGULAR process of the current
buffer (but does not kill the buffer). Once you have killed a
SINGULAR process you can start a new one in the same buffer with
the command singular (or select the item Start default of
the Singular menu).

* singular-restart (bound to C-c C-r or menu
Singular, item Restart)

Kills the running SINGULAR process of the current buffer and starts
a new process in the same buffer with exactly the same command line
arguments as before.

* singular-control-c (bound to C-c C-c or menu Singular, item Interrupt)

Interrupt the Singular process running in the current buffer. Asks
whether to (a)bort the current SINGULAR command,
(q)uit or (r)estart the current SINGULAR process, or
(c)ontinue without doing anything (default).

Whenever a SINGULAR process is started within the Emacs interface,
the contents of a special startup file (by default
~/.emacs-singularrc) is pasted as input to SINGULAR at the
very end of the usual startup sequence (see Startup sequence). The
name of the startup file can be changed, see
Customization of the Emacs interface.
