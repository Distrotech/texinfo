D.5.3.4 isEquising
..................
Procedure from library equising.lib (see equising_lib).

Usage:
isEquising(F[,m,L]); F poly, m int, L list

Assume:
F defines a deformation of a reduced bivariate polynomial f
and the characteristic of the basering does not divide mult(f). 

If nv is the number of variables of the basering, then the first
nv-2 variables are the deformation parameters. 

If the basering is a qring, ideal(basering) must only depend
on the deformation parameters.

Compute:
tests if the given family is equisingular along the trivial
section.

Return:
int: 1 if the family is equisingular, 0 otherwise.

Note:
L is supposed to be the output of reddevelop (with the given ordering
of the variables appearing in f). 

If m is given, the family is considered over A/maxideal(m). 

This procedure uses execute or calls a procedure using
execute.
printlevel>=2 displays additional information.

Example:
LIB "equising.lib";
ring r = 0,(a,b,x,y),ds;
poly F = (x2+2xy+y2+x5)+ay3+bx5;
isEquising(F);
==> 0
ideal I = ideal(a);
qring q = std(I);
poly F = imap(r,F);
isEquising(F);
==> 1
ring rr=0,(A,B,C,x,y),ls;
poly f=x7+y7+(x-y)^2*x2y2;
poly F=f+A*y*diff(f,x)+B*x*diff(f,x);
isEquising(F);  
==> 0
isEquising(F,2);    // computation over  Q[a,b] / <a,b>^2
==> 1
