D.4.7.14 zerodec
................
Procedure from library primdec.lib (see primdec_lib).

Usage:
zerodec(I); I ideal

Assume:
I is zero-dimensional, the characteristic of the ground field is 0

Return:
list of primary ideals, the zero-dimensional decomposition of I

Note:
The algorithm (of Monico), works well only for a small total number
of solutions (vdim(std(I)) should be < 100) and without
parameters. In practice, it works also in large characteristic p>0
but may fail for small p.

 If printlevel > 0 (default = 0) additional information is displayed.

Example:
LIB "primdec.lib";
ring r  = 0,(x,y),dp;
ideal i = x2-2,y2-2;
list pr = zerodec(i);
pr;
==> [1]:
==>    _[1]=y2-2
==>    _[2]=xy-2
==>    _[3]=x2-2
==> [2]:
==>    _[1]=y2-2
==>    _[2]=xy+2
==>    _[3]=x2-2
