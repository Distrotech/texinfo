3 Invoking hello
****************


The format for running the hello program is:

hello option ...

With no options, hello prints the greeting `Hello,
world!'.

hello supports the following options:

`--greeting=text'
`-g text'
Output text instead of the default greeting.

`--help'
`-h'
Print an informative help message on standard output and exit
successfully.

For the `--help' output of GNU programs, it's strongly
encouraged to include a brief (one or two sentences) description of
what the program does, as well as the synopsis of how to run the
program.  Any environment variables which affect execution should also
be mentioned (Hello doesn't have any).

`--next-generation'
`-n'
Output `Hello, world!', but possibly including box-drawing
characters or other fancy stuff, especially in translated locales.
(If you would like to volunteer to translate messages for GNU packages,
please see <http://translationproject.org>.)

`--traditional'
`-t'
Output the traditional greeting message `hello, world'.

`--version'
`-v'
Print the version number and licensing information of Hello on
standard output and then exit successfully.


If more than one of the greeting options (`-g', `-n',
`-t', and their long-named equivalents) is specified, whichever
comes last takes precedence.
