4 Reporting bugs
****************


To report bugs or suggest enhancements for GNU Hello, please
send electronic mail to <mailto:bug-hello@gnu.org>.

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

* The version numbers of Hello (which you can find by running
      `hello --version') and any other program(s) or
      manual(s) involved.
* Hardware and operating system names and versions.
* The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
* The expected behavior and/or output.
* A description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
* Options you gave to configure other than specifying
      installation directories.
* Anything else that you think would be helpful.

When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
better to include too much than to leave out something important.

Patches are welcome; if possible, please make them with `diff
-c' (see Overview in Comparing and Merging Files) and
include `ChangeLog' entries (see Change Log in The GNU Emacs Manual).  Please follow the existing coding style.
