1 What is Info?
***************

Info is a program which is used to view Info files on an ASCII
terminal.  Info files are the result of processing Texinfo files
with the program makeinfo or with one of the Emacs commands, such
as M-x texinfo-format-buffer.  Texinfo itself is a documentation
system that uses a single source file to produce both on-line
information and printed output.  You can typeset and print the files
that you read in Info.
