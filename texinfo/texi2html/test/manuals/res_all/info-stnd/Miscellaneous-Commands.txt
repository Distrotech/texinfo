10 Miscellaneous Commands
*************************

GNU Info contains several commands which self-document GNU Info:

M-x describe-command
Read the name of an Info command in the echo area and then display a
brief description of what that command does.

M-x describe-key
Read a key sequence in the echo area, and then display the name and
documentation of the Info command that the key sequence invokes.

M-x describe-variable
Read the name of a variable in the echo area and then display a brief
description of what the variable affects.

M-x where-is
Read the name of an Info command in the echo area, and then display
a key sequence which can be typed in order to invoke that command.

<C-h> (get-help-window)
<?>
<F1> (on DOS/Windows only)
h, vi-like operation
Create (or Move into) the window displaying *Help*, and place
a node containing a quick reference card into it.  This window displays
the most concise information about GNU Info available.

<h> (get-info-help-node)
<M-h>, vi-like operation
Try hard to visit the node (info)Help.  The Info file
`info.texi' distributed with GNU Info contains this node.  Of
course, the file must first be processed with makeinfo, and then
placed into the location of your Info directory.

Here are the commands for creating a numeric argument:

<C-u> (universal-argument)
Start (or multiply by 4) the current numeric argument.  `C-u' is
a good way to give a small numeric argument to cursor movement or
scrolling commands; `C-u C-v' scrolls the screen 4 lines, while
`C-u C-u C-n' moves the cursor down 16 lines.  `C-u' followed
by digit keys sets the numeric argument to the number thus typed:
C-u 1 2 0 sets the argument to 120.

<M-1> (add-digit-to-numeric-arg)
<1>, vi-like operation
<M-2> ... <M-9>
<2> ... <9>, vi-like operation
<M-0>
<0>, vi-like operation
Add the digit value of the invoking key to the current numeric
argument.  Once Info is reading a numeric argument, you may just type
the digits of the argument, without the Meta prefix.  For example, you
might give `C-l' a numeric argument of 32 by typing:

C-u 3 2 C-l

or

M-3 2 C-l

<M--> (add-digit-to-numeric-arg
<->
To make a negative argument, type -.  Typing - alone makes a
negative argument with a value of -1.  If you continue to type digit or
Meta-digit keys after -, the result is a negative number produced
by those digits.

- doesn't work when you type in the echo area, because you need to
be able to insert the `-' character itself; use M-- instead,
if you need to specify negative arguments in the echo area.

`C-g' is used to abort the reading of a multi-character key
sequence, to cancel lengthy operations (such as multi-file searches) and
to cancel reading input in the echo area.

<C-g> (abort-key)
<C-u>, vi-like operation
Cancel current operation.

The `q' command of Info simply quits running Info.  Under
`--vi-keys' (see --vi-keys), you can also exit with `:q'
or `ZZ'.

<q> (quit)
C-x C-c
:q, vi-like operation
ZZ, vi-like operation
Exit GNU Info.

If the operating system tells GNU Info that the screen is 60 lines tall,
and it is actually only 40 lines tall, here is a way to tell Info that
the operating system is correct.

M-x set-screen-height
Read a height value in the echo area and set the height of the
displayed screen to that value.

On MS-DOS/MS-Windows, this command actually tries to change the
dimensions of the visible screen to the value you type in the echo
area.

Finally, Info provides a convenient way to display footnotes which might
be associated with the current node that you are viewing:

<ESC C-f> (show-footnotes)
Show the footnotes (if any) associated with the current node in another
window.  You can have Info automatically display the footnotes
associated with a node when the node is selected by setting the variable
automatic-footnotes.  See automatic-footnotes.
