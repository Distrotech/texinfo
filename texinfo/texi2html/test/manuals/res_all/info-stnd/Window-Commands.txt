8 Manipulating Multiple Windows
*******************************

A window is a place to show the text of a node.  Windows have a
view area where the text of the node is displayed, and an associated
mode line, which briefly describes the node being viewed.

GNU Info supports multiple windows appearing in a single screen; each
window is separated from the next by its modeline.  At any time, there
is only one active window, that is, the window in which the cursor
appears.  There are commands available for creating windows, changing
the size of windows, selecting which window is active, and for deleting
windows.

* The Mode Line::               What appears in the mode line?
* Basic Windows::               Manipulating windows in Info.
* The Echo Area::               Used for displaying errors and reading input.

8.1 The Mode Line
=================

A mode line is a line of inverse video which appears at the bottom
of an Info window.  It describes the contents of the window just above
it; this information includes the name of the file and node appearing in
that window, the number of screen lines it takes to display the node,
and the percentage of text that is above the top of the window.  It can
also tell you if the indirect tags table for this Info file needs to be
updated, and whether or not the Info file was compressed when stored on
disk.

Here is a sample mode line for a window containing an uncompressed file
named `dir', showing the node `Top'.

-----Info: (dir)Top, 40 lines --Top-------------------------------------
            ^^   ^   ^^^        ^^
          (file)Node #lines    where

When a node comes from a file which is compressed on disk, this is
indicated in the mode line with two small `z''s.  In addition, if
the Info file containing the node has been split into subfiles, the name
of the subfile containing the node appears in the modeline as well:

--zz-Info: (emacs)Top, 291 lines --Top-- Subfile: emacs-1.Z-------------

Truncation of long lines (as opposed to wrapping them to the next
display line, see toggle-wrap) is indicated by a
`$' at the left edge of the mode line:

--$--Info: (texinfo)Top, 480 lines --Top-- Subfile: texinfo-1-----------

When Info makes a node internally, such that there is no corresponding
info file on disk, the name of the node is surrounded by asterisks
(`*').  The name itself tells you what the contents of the window
are; the sample mode line below shows an internally constructed node
showing possible completions:

-----Info: *Completions*, 7 lines --All---------------------------------

8.2 Window Commands
===================

It can be convenient to view more than one node at a time.  To allow
this, Info can display more than one window.  Each window has its
own mode line (see The Mode Line) and history of nodes viewed in that
window (see history-node).

C-x <o> (next-window)
Select the next window on the screen.  Note that the echo area can only be
selected if it is already in use, and you have left it temporarily.
Normally, `C-x o' simply moves the cursor into the next window on
the screen, or if you are already within the last window, into the first
window on the screen.  Given a numeric argument, `C-x o' moves over
that many windows.  A negative argument causes `C-x o' to select
the previous window on the screen.

M-x prev-window
Select the previous window on the screen.  This is identical to
`C-x o' with a negative argument.

C-x <2> (split-window)
Split the current window into two windows, both showing the same node.
Each window is one half the size of the original window, and the cursor
remains in the original window.  The variable automatic-tiling
can cause all of the windows on the screen to be resized for you
automatically, please see automatic-tiling for more
information.

C-x <0> (delete-window)
Delete the current window from the screen.  If you have made too many
windows and your screen appears cluttered, this is the way to get rid of
some of them.

C-x <1> (keep-one-window)
Delete all of the windows excepting the current one.

ESC <C-v> (scroll-other-window)
Scroll the other window, in the same fashion that `C-v' might
scroll the current window.  Given a negative argument, scroll the
"other" window backward.

C-x <^> (grow-window)
Grow (or shrink) the current window.  Given a numeric argument, grow
the current window that many lines; with a negative numeric argument,
shrink the window instead.

C-x <t> (tile-windows)
Divide the available screen space among all of the visible windows.
Each window is given an equal portion of the screen in which to display
its contents.  The variable automatic-tiling can cause
tile-windows to be called when a window is created or deleted.
See automatic-tiling.

8.3 The Echo Area
=================

The echo area is a one line window which appears at the bottom of
the screen.  It is used to display informative or error messages, and to
read lines of input from you when that is necessary.  Almost all of the
commands available in the echo area are identical to their Emacs
counterparts, so please refer to that documentation for greater depth of
discussion on the concepts of editing a line of text.  The following
table briefly lists the commands that are available while input is being
read in the echo area:

<C-f> (echo-area-forward)
<RIGHT> (an arrow key)
<M-h>, vi-like operation
Move forward a character.

<C-b> (echo-area-backward)
<LEFT> (an arrow key)
<M-l>, vi-like operation
Move backward a character.

<C-a> (echo-area-beg-of-line)
<M-0>, vi-like operation
Move to the start of the input line.

<C-e> (echo-area-end-of-line)
<M-$>, vi-like operation
Move to the end of the input line.

<M-f> (echo-area-forward-word)
<C-<RIGHT>> (DOS/Windows only)
<M-w>, vi-like operation
Move forward a word.

On DOS/Windows, C-<RIGHT> moves forward by words.

<M-b> (echo-area-backward-word)
<C-<LEFT>> (DOS/Windows only)
Move backward a word.

On DOS/Windows, C-<LEFT> moves backward by words.

<C-d> (echo-area-delete)
<M-x>, vi-like operation
Delete the character under the cursor.

<DEL> (echo-area-rubout)
Delete the character behind the cursor.

On some keyboards, this key is designated <BS>, for
`BackSpace'.  Those keyboards will usually bind <DEL> in the
echo area to echo-area-delete.

<C-g> (echo-area-abort)
<C-u>, vi-like operation
Cancel or quit the current operation.  If completion is being read, this
command discards the text of the input line which does not match any
completion.  If the input line is empty, it aborts the calling function.

<RET> (echo-area-newline)
Accept (or forces completion of) the current input line.

<C-q> (echo-area-quoted-insert)
<C-v>, vi-like operation
Insert the next character verbatim.  This is how you can insert control
characters into a search string, for example, or the `?' character
when Info prompts with completion.

printing character (echo-area-insert)
Insert the character.  Characters that have their 8th bit set, and not
bound to `M-' commands, are also inserted verbatim; this is useful
for terminals which support Latin scripts.

<M-TAB> (echo-area-tab-insert)
<Shift-<TAB>> (on DOS/Windows only)
Insert a TAB character.

On DOS/Windows only, the Shift-<TAB> key is an alias for
M-<TAB>.  This key is sometimes called `BackTab'.

<C-t> (echo-area-transpose-chars)
Transpose the characters at the cursor.

The next group of commands deal with killing, and yanking
text(6).   For an in depth discussion of killing and
yanking, see (emacs)Killing section `Killing and Deleting' in the GNU Emacs Manual

<M-d> (echo-area-kill-word)
<M-X>, vi-like operation
Kill the word following the cursor.

<M-DEL> (echo-area-backward-kill-word)
<M-<BS>>
Kill the word preceding the cursor.

On some keyboards, the Backspace key is used instead of
DEL, so M-<Backspace> has the same effect as
M-<DEL>.

<C-k> (echo-area-kill-line)
Kill the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

C-x <DEL> (echo-area-backward-kill-line)
Kill the text from the cursor to the beginning of the line.

<C-y> (echo-area-yank)
Yank back the contents of the last kill.

<M-y> (echo-area-yank-pop)
Yank back a previous kill, removing the last yanked text first.

Sometimes when reading input in the echo area, the command that needed
input will only accept one of a list of several choices.  The choices
represent the possible completions, and you must respond with one
of them.  Since there are a limited number of responses you can make,
Info allows you to abbreviate what you type, only typing as much of the
response as is necessary to uniquely identify it.  In addition, you can
request Info to fill in as much of the response as is possible; this
is called completion.

The following commands are available when completing in the echo area:

<TAB> (echo-area-complete)
<SPC>
Insert as much of a completion as is possible.

<?> (echo-area-possible-completions)
Display a window containing a list of the possible completions of what
you have typed so far.  For example, if the available choices are:

bar
foliate
food
forget

and you have typed an `f', followed by `?', Info will pop up a
window showing a node called `*Completions*' which lists the
possible completions like this:

3 completions:
foliate         food
forget

i.e., all of the choices which begin with `f'.  Pressing <SPC>
or <TAB> would result in `fo' appearing in the echo area, since
all of the choices which begin with `f' continue with `o'.
Now, typing `l' followed by `TAB' results in `foliate'
appearing in the echo area, since that is the only choice which begins
with `fol'.

<ESC C-v> (echo-area-scroll-completions-window)
Scroll the completions window, if that is visible, or the "other"
window if not.

Some people are used to calling these operations cut and
paste, respectively.
