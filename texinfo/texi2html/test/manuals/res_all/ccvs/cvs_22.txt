Roland Pesch, then of Cygnus Support <roland@wrs.com>
wrote the manual pages which were distributed with
CVS 1.3.  Much of their text was copied into this
manual.  He also read an early draft
of this manual and contributed many ideas and
corrections.

The mailing-list info-cvs is sometimes
informative. I have included information from postings
made by the following persons:
David G. Grubbs <dgg@think.com>.

Some text has been extracted from the man pages for
RCS.

The CVS FAQ by David G. Grubbs has provided
useful material.  The FAQ is no longer maintained,
however, and this manual is about the closest thing there
is to a successor (with respect to documenting how to
use CVS, at least).

In addition, the following persons have helped by
telling me about mistakes I've made:

Roxanne Brunskill <rbrunski@datap.ca>,
Kathy Dyer <dyer@phoenix.ocf.llnl.gov>,
Karl Pingle <pingle@acuson.com>,
Thomas A Peterson <tap@src.honeywell.com>,
Inge Wallin <ingwa@signum.se>,
Dirk Koschuetzki <koschuet@fmi.uni-passau.de>
and Michael Brown <brown@wi.extrel.com>.

The list of contributors here is not comprehensive; for a more
complete list of who has contributed to this manual see
the file `doc/ChangeLog' in the CVS source
distribution.
