15 Special Files
****************


In normal circumstances, CVS works only with regular
files.  Every file in a project is assumed to be
persistent; it must be possible to open, read and close
them; and so on.  CVS also ignores file permissions and
ownerships, leaving such issues to be resolved by the
developer at installation time.  In other words, it is
not possible to "check in" a device into a repository;
if the device file cannot be opened, CVS will refuse to
handle it.  Files also lose their ownerships and
permissions during repository transactions.
