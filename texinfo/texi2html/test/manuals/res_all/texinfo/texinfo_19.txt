18 Defining New Texinfo Commands
********************************

Texinfo provides several ways to define new commands:

* A Texinfo macro allows you to define a new Texinfo command as any
sequence of text and/or existing commands (including other macros).  The
macro can have any number of parameters--text you supply each
time you use the macro.

Incidentally, these macros have nothing to do with the @defmac
command, which is for documenting macros in the subject of the manual
(see Def Cmd Template).

* `@alias' is a convenient way to define a new name for an existing
command.

* `@definfoenclose' allows you to define new commands with
customized output in the Info file.


* Defining Macros::             Defining and undefining new commands.
* Invoking Macros::             Using a macro, once you've defined it.
* Macro Details::               Beyond basic macro usage.
* alias::                       Command aliases.
* definfoenclose::              Customized highlighting.


18.1 Defining Macros
====================

You use the Texinfo @macro command to define a macro, like this:

@macro macroname{param1, param2, ...}
text ... \param1\ ...
@end macro

The parameters param1, param2, ... correspond to
arguments supplied when the macro is subsequently used in the document
(described in the next section).

For a macro to work with TeX, macroname must consist entirely
of letters: no digits, hyphens, underscores, or other special characters.

If a macro needs no parameters, you can define it either with an empty
list (`@macro foo {}') or with no braces at all (`@macro
foo').

The definition or body of the macro can contain most Texinfo
commands, including previously-defined macros.  Not-yet-defined macro
invocations are not allowed; thus, it is not possible to have mutually
recursive Texinfo macros.  Also, a macro definition that defines another
macro does not work in TeX due to limitations in the design of
@macro.

In the macro body, instances of a parameter name surrounded by
backslashes, as in `\param1\' in the example above, are
replaced by the corresponding argument from the macro invocation.  You
can use parameter names any number of times in the body, including zero.

To get a single `\' in the macro expansion, use `\\'.  Any
other use of `\' in the body yields a warning.

The newlines after the @macro line and before the @end
macro line are ignored, that is, not included in the macro body.  All
other whitespace is treated according to the usual Texinfo rules.

To allow a macro to be used recursively, that is, in an argument to a
call to itself, you must define it with `@rmacro', like this:

@rmacro rmac {arg}
a\arg\b
@end rmacro
...
@rmac{1@rmac{text}2}

This produces the output `a1atextb2b'.  With `@macro' instead of
`@rmacro', an error message is given.

You can undefine a macro foo with @unmacro foo.
It is not an error to undefine a macro that is already undefined.
For example:

@unmacro foo


18.2 Invoking Macros
====================

After a macro is defined (see the previous section), you can use
(invoke) it in your document like this:

@macroname {arg1, arg2, ...}

and the result will be just as if you typed the body of
macroname at that spot.  For example:

@macro foo {p, q}
Together: \p\ & \q\.
@end macro
@foo{a, b}

produces:

Together: a & b.

Thus, the arguments and parameters are separated by commas and delimited
by braces; any whitespace after (but not before) a comma is ignored.
The braces are required in the invocation (but not the definition), even
when the macro takes no arguments, consistent with all other Texinfo
commands.  For example:

@macro argless {}
No arguments here.
@end macro
@argless{}

produces:

No arguments here.

To insert a comma, brace, or backslash in an argument, prepend a
backslash, as in

@macname {\\\{\}\,}

which will pass the (almost certainly error-producing) argument
`\{},' to macname.  However, commas in parameters, even
if escaped by a backslash, might cause trouble in TeX.

If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked
without any braces, the entire rest of the line after the macro name is
supplied as the argument.  For example:

@macro bar {p}
Twice: \p\ & \p\.
@end macro
@bar aah

produces:

Twice: aah & aah.

If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked with
braces, the braced text is passed as the argument, regardless of
commas.  For example:

@macro bar {p}
Twice: \p\ & \p\.
@end macro
@bar{a,b}

produces:

Twice: a,b & a,b.


18.3 Macro Details
==================

Due to unavoidable disparities in the TeX and makeinfo
implementations, Texinfo macros have the following limitations.

* All macros are expanded inside at least one TeX group.  This means
that @set and other such commands will have no effect inside a
macro.

* Macros containing a command which must be on a line by itself, such as a
conditional, cannot be invoked in the middle of a line.

* Commas in macro arguments, even if escaped by a backslash, don't
always work.

* The TeX implementation cannot construct macros that define macros in
the natural way.  To do this, you must use conditionals and raw TeX.
For example:

@ifnottex
@macro ctor {name, arg}
@macro \name\
something involving \arg\ somehow
@end macro
@end macro
@end ifnottex
@tex
\gdef\ctor#1{\ctorx#1,}
\gdef\ctorx#1,#2,{\def#1{something involving #2 somehow}}
@end tex

* It is best to avoid comments inside macro definitions.


If some macro feature causes errors when producing the printed version
of a manual, try expanding the macros with makeinfo by
invoking texi2dvi with the `-e' option; see Format with texi2dvi.

18.4 `@alias new=existing'
==========================

The `@alias' command defines a new command to be just like an
existing one.  This is useful for defining additional markup names, thus
preserving semantic information in the input even though the output
result may be the same.

Write the `@alias' command on a line by itself, followed by the
new command name, an equals sign, and the existing command name.
Whitespace around the equals sign is ignored.  Thus:
@alias new = existing

For example, if your document contains citations for both books and
some other media (movies, for example), you might like to define a
macro @moviecite{} that does the same thing as an ordinary
@cite{} but conveys the extra semantic information as well.
You'd do this as follows:

@alias moviecite = cite

Macros do not always have the same effect due to vagaries of argument
parsing.  Also, aliases are much simpler to define than macros.  So the
command is not redundant.  (It was also heavily used in the Jargon File!)

Aliases must not be recursive, directly or indirectly.

18.5 `definfoenclose': Customized Highlighting
==============================================

A @definfoenclose command may be used to define a highlighting
command for Info, but not for TeX.  A command defined using
@definfoenclose marks text by enclosing it in strings that
precede and follow the text.  You can use this to get closer control of
your Info output.
 
Presumably, if you define a command with @definfoenclose for Info,
you will create a corresponding command for TeX, either in
`texinfo.tex', `texinfo.cnf', or within an `@iftex' in
your document.

Write a @definfoenclose command on a line and follow it with
three arguments separated by commas.  The first argument to
@definfoenclose is the @-command name (without the @);
the second argument is the Info start delimiter string; and the third
argument is the Info end delimiter string.  The latter two arguments
enclose the highlighted text in the Info file.  A delimiter string may
contain spaces.  Neither the start nor end delimiter is required.  If
you do not want a start delimiter but do want an end delimiter, you must
follow the command name with two commas in a row; otherwise, the Info
formatting commands will naturally misinterpret the end delimiter string
you intended as the start delimiter string.

If you do a @definfoenclose on the name of a pre-defined macro
(such as @emph, @strong, @t, or @i), the
enclosure definition will override the built-in definition.
 
An enclosure command defined this way takes one argument in braces; this
is intended for new markup commands (see Marking Text).

For example, you can write:

@definfoenclose phoo,//,\\

near the beginning of a Texinfo file to define @phoo as an Info
formatting command that inserts `//' before and `\\' after the argument
to @phoo.  You can then write @phoo{bar} wherever you
want `//bar\\' highlighted in Info.

Also, for TeX formatting, you could write 

@iftex
@global@let@phoo=@i
@end iftex

to define @phoo as a command that causes TeX to typeset the
argument to @phoo in italics.

Each definition applies to its own formatter: one for TeX, the other
for texinfo-format-buffer or texinfo-format-region.  The
@definfoenclose command need not be within `@ifinfo', but
the raw TeX commands do need to be in `@iftex'.

Here is another example: write

@definfoenclose headword, , :

near the beginning of the file, to define @headword as an Info
formatting command that inserts nothing before and a colon after the
argument to @headword.

`@definfoenclose' definitions must not be recursive, directly or
indirectly.
