Appendix C Sample Texinfo Files
*******************************

The first example is from the first chapter (see Short Sample),
given here in its entirety, without commentary.  The second sample
includes the full texts to be used in GNU manuals.

C.1 Short Sample
================

Here is a complete, short sample Texinfo file, without any commentary.
You can see this file, with comments, in the first chapter.  See Short Sample.

In a nutshell: The makeinfo program transforms a Texinfo
source file such as this into an Info file or HTML; and TeX typesets
it for a printed manual.



\input texinfo   @c -*-texinfo-*-
@c %**start of header
@setfilename sample.info
@settitle Sample Manual 1.0
@c %**end of header

@copying
This is a short example of a complete Texinfo file.

C.2 GNU Sample Texts
====================


Here is a sample Texinfo document with the full texts that should be
used in GNU manuals.

As well as the legal texts, it also serves as a practical example of how
many elements in a GNU system can affect the manual.  If you're not
familiar with all these different elements, don't worry.  They're not
required and a perfectly good manual can be written without them.
They're included here nonetheless because many manuals do (or could)
benefit from them.

See Short Sample, for a minimal example of a Texinfo file.
See Beginning a File, for a full explanation of that minimal
example.

Here are some notes on the example:

* The `Id: texinfo.txi,v 1.2 2003/02/24 18:17:06 pertusus Exp $' comment is for CVS (see (cvs)Top section `Overview' in Concurrent Versions System) or RCS (see rcsintro(1)) version control
systems, which expand it into a string such as:
Id: texinfo.txi,v 1.2 2003/02/24 18:17:06 pertusus Exp $
(This is useful in all sources that use version control, not just manuals.)

* The `version.texi' in the @include command is maintained
automatically by Automake (see (automake)Top section `Introduction' in GNU Automake).  It sets the `VERSION' and `UPDATED' values used
elsewhere.  If your distribution doesn't use Automake, you can mimic
these or equivalent settings.

* The @syncodeindex command reflects the recommendation to use only
one index if at all possible, to make it easier for readers.

* The @dircategory is for constructing the Info directory.
See Installing Dir Entries, which includes a variety of recommended
category names.

* The `Invoking' node is a GNU standard to help users find the basic
information about command-line usage of a given program.  See (standards)Manual Structure Details section `Manual Structure Details' in GNU Coding Standards.

* It is best to include the entire GNU Free Documentation License in a GNU
manual, unless the manual is only a few pages long.  Of course this
sample is even shorter than that, but it includes the FDL anyway in
order to show one conventional way of doing so.  The `fdl.texi'
file is available on the GNU machines (and in the Texinfo and other GNU
distributions).

The FDL provides for omitting itself under certain conditions, but in
that case the sample texts given here have to be modified.  See GNU Free Documentation License.

* If your manual has invariant sections (again, see the license itself for
details), then don't forget to include them.

Here is the sample document:

\input texinfo    @c -*-texinfo-*-
@comment Id: texinfo.txi,v 1.2 2003/02/24 18:17:06 pertusus Exp $
@comment %**start of header
@setfilename sample.info
@include version.texi
@settitle GNU Sample @value{VERSION}
@syncodeindex pg cp
@comment %**end of header
@copying
This manual is for GNU Sample
(version @value{VERSION}, @value{UPDATED}),
which is an example in the Texinfo documentation.
