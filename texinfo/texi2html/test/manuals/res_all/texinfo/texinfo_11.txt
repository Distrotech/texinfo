10 Quotations and Examples
**************************

Quotations and examples are blocks of text consisting of one or more
whole paragraphs that are set off from the bulk of the text and
treated differently.  They are usually indented.

In Texinfo, you always begin a quotation or example by writing an
@-command at the beginning of a line by itself, and end it by writing
an @end command that is also at the beginning of a line by
itself.  For instance, you begin an example by writing @example
by itself at the beginning of a line and end the example by writing
@end example on a line by itself, at the beginning of that
line.

10.1 Block Enclosing Commands
=============================

Here are commands for quotations and examples, explained further in the
following sections:

@quotation
Indicate text that is quoted. The text is filled, indented, and
printed in a roman font by default.

@example
Illustrate code, commands, and the like. The text is printed
in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@verbatim
Mark a piece of text that is to be printed verbatim; no character 
substitutions are made and all commands are ignored, until the next
@end verbatim.  The text is printed in a fixed-width font, 
and not indented or filled.  Extra spaces and blank lines are 
significant, and tabs are expanded.

@smallexample
Same as @example, except that in TeX this command typesets
text in a smaller font.

@lisp
Like @example, but specifically for illustrating Lisp code. The
text is printed in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@smalllisp
Is to @lisp as @smallexample is to @example.

@display
Display illustrative text.  The text is indented but not filled, and
no font is selected (so, by default, the font is roman).

@smalldisplay
Is to @display as @smallexample is to @example.

@format
Like @display (the text is not filled and no font is selected),
but the text is not indented.

@smallformat
Is to @format as @smallexample is to @example.

The @exdent command is used within the above constructs to
undo the indentation of a line.

The @flushleft and @flushright commands are used to line
up the left or right margins of unfilled text.

The @noindent command may be used after one of the above
constructs to prevent the following text from being indented as a new
paragraph.

You can use the @cartouche command within one of the above
constructs to highlight the example or quotation by drawing a box with
rounded corners around it.  See Drawing Cartouches Around Examples.


10.2 @quotation
===============

The text of a quotation is processed normally except that:

* the margins are closer to the center of the page, so the whole of the
quotation is indented;

* the first lines of paragraphs are indented no more than other
lines;

* in the printed output, interparagraph spacing is reduced.

This is an example of text written between an @quotation
command and an @end quotation command.  An @quotation
command is most often used to indicate text that is excerpted from
another (real or hypothetical) printed work.

Write an @quotation command as text on a line by itself.  This
line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the quotation
with a line beginning with and containing only @end quotation.
The @end quotation line will likewise disappear from the
output.  Thus, the following,

@quotation
This is
a foo.
@end quotation

produces

This is a foo.


10.3 @example: Example Text
===========================

The @example command is used to indicate an example that is
not part of the running text, such as computer input or output.

This is an example of text written between an
@example command
and an @end example command.
The text is indented but not filled.

In the printed manual, the text is typeset in a
fixed-width font, and extra spaces and blank lines are
significant.  In the Info file, an analogous result is
obtained by indenting each line with five spaces.

Write an @example command at the beginning of a line by itself.
Mark the end of the example
with an @end example command, also written at the beginning of a
line by itself.

For example,

@example
mv foo bar
@end example

produces

mv foo bar

The lines containing @example and @end example
will disappear from the output.
To make the output look good,
you should put a blank line before the
@example and another blank line after the @end example.
Note that blank lines inside the beginning
@example and the ending @end example will appear in
the output.

Caution: Do not use tabs in the lines of an example or anywhere
else in Texinfo (except in verbatim environments)!  The TeX
implementation of Texinfo treats tabs as single spaces, and that is not
what they look like.  (If necessary, in Emacs, you can use M-x
untabify to convert tabs in a region to multiple spaces.)

Examples are often, logically speaking, "in the middle" of a
paragraph, and the text that continues after an example should not be
indented.  The @noindent command prevents a piece of text from
being indented as if it were a new paragraph.
(See noindent.)

(The @code command is used for examples of code that are
embedded within sentences, not set off from preceding and following
text.  See @code.)


10.4 @verbatim: Literal Text
============================

Use the @verbatim environment for printing of text that may
contain special characters or commands that should not be interpreted,
such as computer input or output (@example interprets its text
as regular Texinfo commands).  This is especially useful for including
automatically generated output in a Texinfo manual.  Here is an example;
the output you see is just the same as the input, with a line
@verbatim before and a line @end verbatim after.

This is an example of text written in a @verbatim
block.  No character substitutions are made.  All commands
are ignored, until `<at>end verbatim'.

In the printed manual, the text is typeset in a
fixed-width font, and not indented or filled.  All
spaces and blank lines are significant, including tabs.

Write a @verbatim command at the beginning of a line by itself.
This line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the verbatim
block with a @end verbatim command, also written at the
beginning of a line by itself.  The @end verbatim will also
disappear from the output.

For example:

@verbatim
{
<tab>@command with strange characters: @'e 
expand<tab>me
}
@end verbatim

produces

{
	@command with strange characters: @'e 
expand	me
}

Since the lines containing @verbatim and @end verbatim
produce no output, tyically you should put a blank line before the
@verbatim and another blank line after the @end
verbatim.  Blank lines between the beginning @verbatim and the
ending @end verbatim will appear in the output.


10.5 @verbatiminclude file: Include a File Verbatim
===================================================

You can include the exact contents of a file in the document with the
@verbatiminclude command:

@verbatiminclude filename

The contents of filename is printed in a verbatim environment
(see @verbatim).  Generally, the file is printed
exactly as it is, with all special characters and white space retained.


10.6 @lisp: Marking a Lisp Example
==================================

The @lisp command is used for Lisp code.  It is synonymous
with the @example command.

This is an example of text written between an
@lisp command and an @end lisp command.

Use @lisp instead of @example to preserve information
regarding the nature of the example.  This is useful, for example, if
you write a function that evaluates only and all the Lisp code in a
Texinfo file.  Then you can use the Texinfo file as a Lisp
library.(7)

Mark the end of @lisp with @end lisp on a line by
itself.


10.7 @small... Block Commands
=============================

In addition to the regular @example and @lisp commands,
Texinfo has "small" example-style commands.  These are
@smalldisplay, @smallexample, @smallformat, and
@smalllisp.

In TeX, the @small... commands typeset text in a smaller
font than the non-small example commands.  Consequently, many examples
containing long lines fit on a page without needing to be shortened.

In Info, the @small... commands are equivalent to their
non-small companion commands.

Mark the end of an @small... block with a corresponding
@end small....  For example, pair @smallexample with
@end smallexample.

This is an example of text written between @smallexample and
@end smallexample.  In Info this text appears in its normal size;
but in a 7 by 9.25 inch manual, this text appears in a smaller font.

The @small... commands make it easier to prepare manuals
without forcing you to edit examples by hand to fit them onto narrower
pages.

As a general rule, a printed document looks better if you use only one
of (for example) @example or in @smallexample
consistently within a chapter.  Only occasionally should you mix the two
formats.

See Printing "Small" Books, for more information
about the @smallbook command.


10.8 @display and @smalldisplay
===============================

The @display command begins a kind of example.  It is like the
@example command
except that, in
a printed manual, @display does not select the fixed-width
font.  In fact, it does not specify the font at all, so that the text
appears in the same font it would have appeared in without the
@display command.

This is an example of text written between an @display command
and an @end display command.  The @display command
indents the text, but does not fill it.

Texinfo also provides a command @smalldisplay, which is like
@display but uses a smaller font in @smallbook format.
See small.


10.9 @format and @smallformat
=============================

The @format command is similar to @example except
that, in the printed manual, @format does not select the
fixed-width font and does not narrow the margins.

This is an example of text written between an @format command
and an @end format command.  As you can see
from this example,
the @format command does not fill the text.

Texinfo also provides a command @smallformat, which is like
@format but uses a smaller font in @smallbook format.
See small.



10.10 @exdent: Undoing a Line's Indentation
===========================================

The @exdent command removes any indentation a line might have.
The command is written at the beginning of a line and applies only to
the text that follows the command that is on the same line.  Do not use
braces around the text.  In a printed manual, the text on an
@exdent line is printed in the roman font.

@exdent is usually used within examples.  Thus,

@example
This line follows an @@example command.
@exdent This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @@end example comes on the next line.
@end group

produces

This line follows an @example command.
This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @end example comes on the next line.

In practice, the @exdent command is rarely used.
Usually, you un-indent text by ending the example and
returning the page to its normal width.


10.11 @flushleft and @flushright
================================

The @flushleft and @flushright commands line up the
ends of lines on the left and right margins of a page,
but do not fill the text.  The commands are written on lines of their
own, without braces.  The @flushleft and @flushright
commands are ended by @end flushleft and @end
flushright commands on lines of their own.

For example,

@flushleft
This text is
written flushleft.
@end flushleft

produces

This text is
written flushleft.


@flushright produces the type of indentation often used in the
return address of letters.  For example,

@flushright
Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @code{@flushright} command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.
@end flushright

produces

Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @flushright command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.


10.12 @noindent: Omitting Indentation
=====================================

An example or other inclusion can break a paragraph into segments.
Ordinarily, the formatters indent text that follows an example as a new
paragraph.  However, you can prevent this by writing @noindent
at the beginning of a line by itself preceding the continuation
text.

For example:

@example
This is an example
@end example

@noindent
This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@code{@@display} and @code{@@end display}.)

produces

This is an example

This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@display and @end display.)

To adjust the number of blank lines properly in the Info file output,
remember that the line containing @noindent does not generate a
blank line, and neither does the @end example line.

In the Texinfo source file for this manual, each line that says
`produces' is preceded by a line containing @noindent.

Do not put braces after an @noindent command; they are not
necessary, since @noindent is a command used outside of
paragraphs (see Command Syntax).


10.13 @cartouche: Rounded Rectangles Around Examples
====================================================

In a printed manual, the @cartouche command draws a box with
rounded corners around its contents.  You can use this command to
further highlight an example or quotation.  For instance, you could
write a manual in which one type of example is surrounded by a cartouche
for emphasis.

@cartouche affects only the printed manual; it has no effect in
other output files.

For example,

@example
@cartouche
% pwd
/usr/local/share/emacs
@end cartouche
@end example

surrounds the two-line example with a box with rounded corners, in the
printed manual.
