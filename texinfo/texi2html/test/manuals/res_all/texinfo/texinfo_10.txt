9 Marking Words and Phrases
***************************

In Texinfo, you can mark words and phrases in a variety of ways.
The Texinfo formatters use this information to determine how to
highlight the text.
You can specify, for example, whether a word or phrase is a
defining occurrence, a metasyntactic variable, or a symbol used in a
program.  Also, you can emphasize text, in several different ways.

* Emphasis::                    How to emphasize text.


9.1 Indicating Definitions, Commands, etc.
==========================================

Texinfo has commands for indicating just what kind of object a piece of
text refers to.  For example, metasyntactic variables are marked by
@var, and code by @code.  Since the pieces of text are
labelled by commands that tell what kind of object they are, it is easy
to change the way the Texinfo formatters prepare such text.  (Texinfo is
an intentional formatting language rather than a typesetting
formatting language.)

For example, in a printed manual,
code is usually illustrated in a typewriter font;
@code tells TeX to typeset this text in this font.  But it
would be easy to change the way TeX highlights code to use another
font, and this change would not affect how keystroke examples are
highlighted.  If straight typesetting commands were used in the body
of the file and you wanted to make a change, you would need to check
every single occurrence to make sure that you were changing code and
not something else that should not be changed.

* url::                         Indicating a World Wide Web reference.
* email::                       Indicating an electronic mail address.


Useful Highlighting
-------------------
Highlighting Commands are Useful
--------------------------------

The highlighting commands can be used to extract useful information
from the file, such as lists of functions or file names.  It is
possible, for example, to write a program in Emacs Lisp (or a keyboard
macro) to insert an index entry after every paragraph that contains
words or phrases marked by a specified command.  You could do this to
construct an index of functions if you had not already made the
entries.

The commands serve a variety of purposes:

@code{sample-code}
Indicate text that is a literal example of a piece of a program.

@kbd{keyboard-characters}
Indicate keyboard input.

@key{key-name}
Indicate the conventional name for a key on a keyboard.

@samp{text}
Indicate text that is a literal example of a sequence of characters.

@var{metasyntactic-variable}
Indicate a metasyntactic variable.

@env{environment-variable}
Indicate an environment variable.

@file{file-name}
Indicate the name of a file.

@command{command-name}
Indicate the name of a command.

@option{option}
Indicate a command-line option.

@dfn{term}
Indicate the introductory or defining use of a term.

@cite{reference}
Indicate the name of a book.

@acronym{acronym}
Indicate an acronym.

@url{uniform-resource-locator}
Indicate a uniform resource locator for the World Wide Web.

@email{email-address[, displayed-text]}
Indicate an electronic mail address.



9.1.1 @code{sample-code}
------------------------

Use the @code command to indicate text that is a piece of a
program and which consists of entire syntactic tokens.  Enclose the
text in braces.

Thus, you should use @code for an expression in a program, for
the name of a variable or function used in a program, or for a
keyword in a programming language.

Use @code for command names in languages that resemble
programming languages, such as Texinfo.  For example, @code and
@samp are produced by writing `@code{@@code}' and
`@code{@@samp}' in the Texinfo source, respectively.

It is incorrect to alter the case of a word inside an @code
command when it appears at the beginning of a sentence.  Most computer
languages are case sensitive.  In C, for example, Printf is
different from the identifier printf, and most likely is a
misspelling of it.  Even in languages which are not case sensitive, it
is confusing to a human reader to see identifiers spelled in different
ways.  Pick one spelling and always use that.  If you do not want to
start a sentence with a command name written all in lower case, you
should rearrange the sentence.

In the printed manual, @code causes TeX to typeset the
argument in a typewriter face.  In the Info file, it causes the Info
formatting commands to use single quotation marks around the text.

For example,

The function returns @code{nil}.

produces this in the printed manual:

The function returns nil.


Here are some cases for which it is preferable not to use @code:

* For shell command names such as ls (use @command).

* For shell options such as `-c' when such options stand alone (use
@option).

* Also, an entire shell command often looks better if written using
@samp rather than @code.  In this case, the rule is to
choose the more pleasing format.

* For environment variable such as TEXINPUTS (use @env).

* For a string of characters shorter than a syntactic token.  For example,
if you are writing about `goto-ch', which is just a part of the
name for the goto-char Emacs Lisp function, you should use
@samp.

* In general, when writing about the characters used in a token; for
example, do not use @code when you are explaining what letters
or printable symbols can be used in the names of functions.  (Use
@samp.)  Also, you should not use @code to mark text
that is considered input to programs unless the input is written in a
language that is like a programming language.  For example, you should
not use @code for the keystroke commands of GNU Emacs (use
@kbd instead) although you may use @code for the names
of the Emacs Lisp functions that the keystroke commands invoke.


Since @command, @option, and @env were
introduced relatively recently, it is acceptable to use @code or
@samp for command names, options, and environment variables.
The new commands allow you to express the markup more precisely, but
there is no real harm in using the older commands, and of course the
long-standing manuals do so.


9.1.2 @kbd{keyboard-characters}
-------------------------------

Use the @kbd command for characters of input to be typed by
users.  For example, to refer to the characters M-a,
write

@kbd{M-a}

and to refer to the characters M-x shell, write

@kbd{M-x shell}

The @kbd command has the same effect as @code in Info,
but by default produces a different font (slanted typewriter instead of
normal typewriter) in the printed manual, so users can distinguish the
characters they are supposed to type from those the computer outputs.

Since the usage of @kbd varies from manual to manual, you can
control the font switching with the @kbdinputstyle command.
This command has no effect on Info output.  Write this command at the
beginning of a line with a single word as an argument, one of the
following:
`code'
Always use the same font for @kbd as @code.
`example'
Use the distinguishing font for @kbd only in @example
and similar environments.
`distinct'
(the default) Always use the distinguishing font for @kbd.

You can embed another @-command inside the braces of an @kbd
command.  Here, for example, is the way to describe a command that
would be described more verbosely as "press an `r' and then
press the <RET> key":

@kbd{r @key{RET}}

This produces: r <RET>

You also use the @kbd command if you are spelling out the letters
you type; for example:

To give the @code{logout} command,
type the characters @kbd{l o g o u t @key{RET}}.

This produces:

To give the logout command,
type the characters l o g o u t <RET>.

(Also, this example shows that you can add spaces for clarity.  If you
really want to mention a space character as one of the characters of
input, write @key{SPC} for it.)


9.1.3 @key{key-name}
--------------------

Use the @key command for the conventional name for a key on a
keyboard, as in:

@key{RET}

You can use the @key command within the argument of an
@kbd command when the sequence of characters to be typed
includes one or more keys that are described by name.

For example, to produce C-x <ESC> you would type:

@kbd{C-x @key{ESC}}

Here is a list of the recommended names for keys:

SPC
Space
RET
Return
LFD
Linefeed (however, since most keyboards nowadays do not have a Linefeed key,
it might be better to call this character C-j.
TAB
Tab
BS
Backspace
ESC
Escape
DEL
Delete
SHIFT
Shift
CTRL
Control
META
Meta

There are subtleties to handling words like `meta' or `ctrl' that are
names of modifier keys.  When mentioning a character in which the
modifier key is used, such as Meta-a, use the @kbd command
alone; do not use the @key command; but when you are referring
to the modifier key in isolation, use the @key command.  For
example, write `@kbd{Meta-a}' to produce Meta-a and
`@key{META}' to produce <META>.


9.1.4 @samp{text}
-----------------

Use the @samp command to indicate text that is a literal example
or `sample' of a sequence of characters in a file, string, pattern, etc.
Enclose the text in braces.  The argument appears within single
quotation marks in both the Info file and the printed manual; in
addition, it is printed in a fixed-width font.

To match @samp{foo} at the end of the line,
use the regexp @samp{foo$}.

produces

To match `foo' at the end of the line, use the regexp
`foo$'.

Any time you are referring to single characters, you should use
@samp unless @kbd or @key is more appropriate.
Also, you may use @samp for entire statements in C and for entire
shell commands--in this case, @samp often looks better than
@code.  Basically, @samp is a catchall for whatever is
not covered by @code, @kbd, or @key.

Only include punctuation marks within braces if they are part of the
string you are specifying.  Write punctuation marks outside the braces
if those punctuation marks are part of the English text that surrounds
the string.  In the following sentence, for example, the commas and
period are outside of the braces:

In English, the vowels are @samp{a}, @samp{e},
@samp{i}, @samp{o}, @samp{u}, and sometimes
@samp{y}.

This produces:

In English, the vowels are `a', `e',
`i', `o', `u',  and sometimes
`y'.


9.1.5 @verb{<char>text<char>}
-----------------------------

Use the @verb command to print a verbatim sequence of
characters.

Like LaTeX's \verb command, the verbatim text can be quoted using
any unique delimiter character.  Enclose the verbatim text, including the
delimiters, in braces.  Text is printed in a fixed-width font:

How many @verb{|@|}-escapes does one need to print this
@verb{.@a @b @c.} string or @verb{+@'e?`!`{}\+} this?

produces

How many @ -escapes does one need to print this
@a @b @c string or these @'e?`{}!`\ this?

This is in contrast to @samp (see the previous
section), whose argument is normal Texinfo text, where the characters
@{} are special; with @verb, nothing is special except
the delimiter character you choose.


9.1.6 @var{metasyntactic-variable}
----------------------------------

Use the @var command to indicate metasyntactic variables.  A
metasyntactic variable is something that stands for another piece of
text.  For example, you should use a metasyntactic variable in the
documentation of a function to describe the arguments that are passed
to that function.

Do not use @var for the names of particular variables in
programming languages.  These are specific names from a program, so
@code is correct for them (see code).  For example, the
Emacs Lisp variable texinfo-tex-command is not a metasyntactic
variable; it is properly formatted using @code.

Do not use @var for environment variables either; @env
is correct for them (see the next section).

The effect of @var in the Info file is to change the case of the
argument to all upper case.  In the printed manual and HTML output, the
argument is printed in slanted type.  

For example,

To delete file @var{filename},
type @samp{rm @var{filename}}.

produces

To delete file filename, type `rm filename'.

(Note that @var may appear inside @code,
@samp, @file, etc.)

Write a metasyntactic variable all in lower case without spaces, and
use hyphens to make it more readable.  Thus, the Texinfo source for
the illustration of how to begin a Texinfo manual looks like
this:

\input texinfo
@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@@settitle @var{name-of-manual}

This produces:

\input texinfo
@setfilename info-file-name
@settitle name-of-manual

In some documentation styles, metasyntactic variables are shown with
angle brackets, for example:

..., type rm <filename>

However, that is not the style that Texinfo uses.  (You can, of
course, modify the sources to `texinfo.tex' and the Info formatting commands
to output the <...> format if you wish.)


9.1.7 @env{environment-variable}
--------------------------------

Use the @env command to indicate environment variables, as used
by many operating systems, including GNU.  Do not use it for
metasyntactic variables; use @var instead (see the previous
section).

@env is equivalent to @code in its effects.
For example:

The @env{PATH} environment variable ...
produces
The PATH environment variable ...


9.1.8 @file{file-name}
----------------------

Use the @file command to indicate text that is the name of a
file, buffer, or directory, or is the name of a node in Info.  You can
also use the command for file name suffixes.  Do not use @file
for symbols in a programming language; use @code.

Currently, @file is equivalent to @samp in its effects.
For example,

The @file{.el} files are in
the @file{/usr/local/emacs/lisp} directory.

produces

The `.el' files are in
the `/usr/local/emacs/lisp' directory.


9.1.9 @command{command-name}
----------------------------

Use the @command command to indicate command names, such as
ls or cc.

@command is equivalent to @code in its effects.
For example:

The command @command{ls} lists directory contents.
produces
The command ls lists directory contents.

You should write the name of a program in the ordinary text font, rather
than using @command, if you regard it as a new English word,
such as `Emacs' or `Bison'.

When writing an entire shell command invocation, as in `ls -l',
you should use either @samp or @code at your discretion.


9.1.10 @option{option-name}
---------------------------

Use the @option command to indicate a command-line option; for
example, `-l' or `--version' or
`--output=filename'.

@option is equivalent to @samp in its effects.
For example:

The option @option{-l} produces a long listing.
produces
The option `-l' produces a long listing.

In tables, putting options inside @code produces a
more pleasing effect.

9.1.11 @dfn{term}
-----------------

Use the @dfn command to identify the introductory or defining
use of a technical term.  Use the command only in passages whose
purpose is to introduce a term which will be used again or which the
reader ought to know.  Mere passing mention of a term for the first
time does not deserve @dfn.  The command generates italics in
the printed manual, and double quotation marks in the Info file.  For
example:

Getting rid of a file is called @dfn{deleting} it.

produces

Getting rid of a file is called deleting it.

As a general rule, a sentence containing the defining occurrence of a
term should be a definition of the term.  The sentence does not need
to say explicitly that it is a definition, but it should contain the
information of a definition--it should make the meaning clear.

9.1.12 @cite{reference}
-----------------------

Use the @cite command for the name of a book that lacks a
companion Info file.  The command produces italics in the printed
manual, and quotation marks in the Info file.

If a book is written in Texinfo, it is better to use a cross reference
command since a reader can easily follow such a reference in Info.
See @xref.




9.1.13 @acronym{acronym}
------------------------

Use the @acronym command for abbreviations written in all
capital letters, such as `NASA'.  The abbreviation is given as
the single argument in braces, as in `@acronym{NASA}'.  As
a matter of style, or for particular abbreviations, you may prefer to
use periods, as in `@acronym{F.B.I.}'.

In TeX and HTML, the argument is printed in a slightly smaller font
size.  In Info or plain text output, this command changes nothing.


9.1.14 @url{uniform-resource-locator}
-------------------------------------

Use the @url command to indicate a uniform resource locator on
the World Wide Web.  This is analogous to @file, @var,
etc., and is purely for markup purposes.  It does not produce a link you
can follow in HTML output (use the @uref command for that,
see @uref).  It is useful for url's which do
not actually exist.  For example:

For example, the url might be @url{http://example.org/path}.

which produces:

For example, the url might be <http://example.org/path>.


9.1.15 @email{email-address[, displayed-text]}
----------------------------------------------

Use the @email command to indicate an electronic mail address.
It takes one mandatory argument, the address, and one optional argument, the
text to display (the default is the address itself).

In Info and TeX, the address is shown in angle brackets, preceded by
the text to display if any.  In HTML output, @email produces a
`mailto' link that usually brings up a mail composition window.
For example:

Send bug reports to @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org},
suggestions to the @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org, same place}.
produces
Send bug reports to <mailto:bug-texinfo@gnu.org>,
suggestions to the same place <mailto:bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.


9.2 Emphasizing Text
====================

Usually, Texinfo changes the font to mark words in the text according to
what category the words belong to; an example is the @code command.
Most often, this is the best way to mark words.
However, sometimes you will want to emphasize text without indicating a
category.  Texinfo has two commands to do this.  Also, Texinfo has
several commands that specify the font in which TeX will typeset
text.  These commands have no effect on Info and only one of them,
the @r command, has any regular use.

* emph & strong::               How to emphasize text in Texinfo.
* Smallcaps::                   How to use the small caps font.
* Fonts::                       Various font commands for printed output.

9.2.1 @emph{text} and @strong{text}
-----------------------------------

The @emph and @strong commands are for emphasis;
@strong is stronger.  In printed output, @emph produces
italics and @strong produces bold.

For example,

@quotation
@strong{Caution:} @samp{rm * .[^.]*} removes @emph{all}
files in the directory.
@end quotation

produces:

     *Caution*: `rm * .[^.]*' removes _all_
     files in the directory.

The @strong command is seldom used except to mark what is, in
effect, a typographical element, such as the word `Caution' in the
preceding example.

In the Info output, @emph surrounds the text with underscores
(`_'), and @strong puts asterisks around the text.

Caution: Do not use @strong with the word `Note';
Info will mistake the combination for a cross reference.  Use a phrase
such as Please note or Caution instead.


9.2.2 @sc{text}: The Small Caps Font
------------------------------------

Use the `@sc' command to set text in the printed and the HTML
output in A SMALL CAPS FONT and set text in the Info file in upper
case letters.  Write the text you want to be in small caps (where
possible) between braces in lower case, like this:

The @sc{acm} and @sc{ieee} are technical societies.

This produces:

The ACM and IEEE are technical societies.

TeX typesets the small caps font in a manner that prevents the
letters from `jumping out at you on the page'.  This makes small caps
text easier to read than text in all upper case--but it's usually
better to use regular mixed case anyway.  The Info formatting commands
set all small caps text in upper case.  In HTML, the text is upper-cased
and a smaller font is used to render it.

If the text between the braces of an @sc command is uppercase,
TeX typesets in FULL-SIZE CAPITALS.  Use full-size capitals
sparingly, if ever, and since it's redundant to mark all-uppercase text
with @sc, makeinfo warns about such usage.

You may also use the small caps font for a jargon word such as
ATO (a NASA word meaning `abort to orbit').

There are subtleties to using the small caps font with a jargon word
such as CDR, a word used in Lisp programming.  In this case, you
should use the small caps font when the word refers to the second and
subsequent elements of a list (the CDR of the list), but you
should use `@code' when the word refers to the Lisp function of
the same spelling.


9.2.3 Fonts for Printing, Not Info
----------------------------------

Texinfo provides four font commands that specify font changes in the
printed manual but have no effect in the Info file.  @i
requests italic font (in some versions of TeX, a slanted font
is used), @b requests bold face, @t requests the
fixed-width, typewriter-style font used by @code, and @r requests a
roman font, which is the usual font in which text is printed.  All
four commands apply to an argument that follows, surrounded by
braces.

Only the @r command has much use: in example programs, you
can use the @r command to convert code comments from the
fixed-width font to a roman font.  This looks better in printed
output.

For example,

@lisp
(+ 2 2)    ; @r{Add two plus two.}
@end lisp

produces

(+ 2 2)    ; Add two plus two.

If possible, you should avoid using the other three font commands.  If
you need to use one, it probably indicates a gap in the Texinfo
language.
