(1)
The first syllable of "Texinfo" is pronounced
like "speck", not "hex".  This odd pronunciation is derived from,
but is not the same as, the pronunciation of TeX.  In the word
TeX, the `X' is actually the Greek letter "chi" rather than
the English letter "ex".  Pronounce TeX as if the `X' were the
last sound in the name `Bach'; but pronounce Texinfo as if the `x'
were a `k'.  Spell "Texinfo" with a capital "T" and the other
letters in lower case.

(2)
In some documents, the first child has no `Previous'
pointer.  Occasionally, the last child has the node name of the next
following higher level node as its `Next' pointer.

(3)
You can also use the
texi2roff <ftp://tug.org/texi2roff.tar.gz> program if you
do not have TeX; since Texinfo is designed for use with TeX,
texi2roff is not described here.  texi2roff is not part of
the standard GNU distribution and is not maintained or up-to-date with
all the Texinfo features described in this manual.

(4)
The word
argument comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not
refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information
presented to the command.  According to the Oxford English
Dictionary, the word derives from the Latin for to make clear,
prove; thus it came to mean `the evidence offered as proof', which is
to say, `the information offered', which led to its mathematical
meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean `to
assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions',
which led to the meaning of `argument' as a dispute.

(5)
We have found
that it is helpful to refer to versions of independent manuals as
`editions' and versions of programs as `versions'; otherwise, we find we
are liable to confuse each other in conversation by referring to both
the documentation and the software with the same words.

(6)
Menus can
carry you to any node, regardless of the hierarchical structure; even to
nodes in a different Info file.  However, the GNU Emacs Texinfo mode
updating commands work only to create menus of subordinate nodes.
Conventionally, cross references are used to refer to other nodes.

(7)
It would be straightforward to extend Texinfo to work
in a similar fashion for C, Fortran, or other languages.

A footnote should complement or expand upon
the primary text, but a reader should not need to read a footnote to
understand the primary text.  For a thorough discussion of footnotes,
see The Chicago Manual of Style, which is published by the
University of Chicago Press.

Here
is the sample footnote.

Note the use
of the `;' character, instead of `:', as directory separator
on these systems.

(11)
On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, Info will
try the `.inf' extension as well.

(12)
Note the
use of `;' as the directory separator, and a different syntax for
using values of other environment variables.

(13)
On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, use semi-colon instead.

(14)
Perhaps the command should have been
called the @refillandindent command, but @refill is
shorter and the name was chosen before indenting was possible.
