Appendix G Refilling Paragraphs
*******************************

The @refill command refills and, optionally, indents the first
line of a paragraph.(14) The
@refill command is no longer important, but we describe it here
because you once needed it.  You will see it in many old Texinfo
files.

Without refilling, paragraphs containing long @-constructs may look
bad after formatting because the formatter removes @-commands and
shortens some lines more than others.  In the past, neither the
texinfo-format-region command nor the
texinfo-format-buffer command refilled paragraphs
automatically.  The @refill command had to be written at the
end of every paragraph to cause these formatters to fill them.  (Both
TeX and makeinfo have always refilled paragraphs
automatically.)  Now, all the Info formatters automatically fill and
indent those paragraphs that need to be filled and indented.

The @refill command causes texinfo-format-region and
texinfo-format-buffer to refill a paragraph in the Info file
after all the other processing has been done.  For this reason,
you can not use @refill with a paragraph containing either
@* or @w{ ... } since the refilling action will
override those two commands.

The texinfo-format-region and texinfo-format-buffer
commands now automatically append @refill to the end of each
paragraph that should be filled.  They do not append @refill to
the ends of paragraphs that contain @* or @w{ ...}
and therefore do not refill or indent them.
