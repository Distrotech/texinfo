=== Moving and renaming files ===
<div id="index-Moving-files"></div>

Moving files to a different directory or renaming them
is not difficult, but some of the ways in which this
works may be non-obvious.  (Moving or renaming a
directory is even harder.  See [[cvs: Moving and renaming directories#Moving and renaming directories|Moving directories]].).

The examples below assume that the file <var>old</var> is renamed to
<var>new</var>.
