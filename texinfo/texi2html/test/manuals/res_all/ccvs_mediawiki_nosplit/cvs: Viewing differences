You do not remember modifying &lsquo;<tt>driver.c</tt>&rsquo;, so you want to see what
has happened to that file.

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cd tc
 $ cvs diff driver.c
</div>

This command runs <code>diff</code> to compare the version of &lsquo;<tt>driver.c</tt>&rsquo;
that you checked out with your working copy.  When you see the output
you remember that you added a command line option that enabled the
optimization pass.  You check it in, and release the module.

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cvs commit -m &quot;Added an optimization pass&quot; driver.c
 Checking in driver.c;
 /usr/local/cvsroot/tc/driver.c,v  &lt;--  driver.c
 new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1

 $ cd ..
 $ cvs release -d tc
