==== Using watches with old versions of CVS ====

<div id="index-CVS-1_002e6_002c-and-watches"></div>
<p>If you use the watch features on a repository, it
creates &lsquo;<tt>CVS</tt>&rsquo; directories in the repository and
stores the information about watches in that directory.
If you attempt to use <small>CVS</small> 1.6 or earlier with the
repository, you get an error message such as the
following (all on one line):
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>cvs update: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading:
No such file or directory
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>and your operation will likely be aborted.  To use the
watch features, you must upgrade all copies of <small>CVS</small>
which use that repository in local or server mode.  If
you cannot upgrade, use the <code>watch off</code> and
<code>watch remove</code> commands to remove all watches, and
that will restore the repository to a state which
<small>CVS</small> 1.6 can cope with.
