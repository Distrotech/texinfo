=== How data is stored in the repository ===
<div id="index-Repository_002c-how-data-is-stored"></div>

<p>For most purposes it isn&rsquo;t important <em>how</em>
<small>CVS</small> stores information in the repository.  In
fact, the format has changed in the past, and is likely
to change in the future.  Since in almost all cases one
accesses the repository via <small>CVS</small> commands, such
changes need not be disruptive.
</p>
<p>However, in some cases it may be necessary to
understand how <small>CVS</small> stores data in the repository,
for example you might need to track down <small>CVS</small> locks
(see [cvs: Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS#Concurrency Concurrency]) or you might need to deal with
the file permissions appropriate for the repository.
