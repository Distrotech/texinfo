=== Moving a repository ===

<p>Just as backing up the files in the repository is
pretty much like backing up any other files, if you
need to move a repository from one place to another it
is also pretty much like just moving any other
collection of files.
</p>
<p>The main thing to consider is that working directories
point to the repository.  The simplest way to deal with
a moved repository is to just get a fresh working
directory after the move.  Of course, you&rsquo;ll want to
make sure that the old working directory had been
checked in before the move, or you figured out some
other way to make sure that you don&rsquo;t lose any
changes.  If you really do want to reuse the existing
working directory, it should be possible with manual
surgery on the &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Repository</tt>&rsquo; files.  You can
see [cvs: How data is stored in the working directory#Working-directory-storage How data is stored in the working directory], for information on
the &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Repository</tt>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Root</tt>&rsquo; files, but
unless you are sure you want to bother, it probably
isn&rsquo;t worth it.
