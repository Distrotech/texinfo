You will notice that sometimes <small>CVS</small> stores an
<small>RCS</small> file in the <code>Attic</code>.  For example, if the
<small>CVSROOT</small> is &lsquo;<tt>/usr/local/cvsroot</tt>&rsquo; and we are
talking about the file &lsquo;<tt>backend.c</tt>&rsquo; in the
directory &lsquo;<tt>yoyodyne/tc</tt>&rsquo;, then the file normally
would be in

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 /usr/local/cvsroot/yoyodyne/tc/backend.c,v
</div>

but if it goes in the attic, it would be in

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 /usr/local/cvsroot/yoyodyne/tc/Attic/backend.c,v
</div>

<div id="index-Dead-state"></div>
instead.  It should not matter from a user point of
view whether a file is in the attic; <small>CVS</small> keeps
track of this and looks in the attic when it needs to.
But in case you want to know, the rule is that the RCS
file is stored in the attic if and only if the head
revision on the trunk has state <code>dead</code>.  A
<code>dead</code> state means that file has been removed, or
never added, for that revision.  For example, if you
add a file on a branch, it will have a trunk revision
in <code>dead</code> state, and a branch revision in a
non-<code>dead</code> state.
