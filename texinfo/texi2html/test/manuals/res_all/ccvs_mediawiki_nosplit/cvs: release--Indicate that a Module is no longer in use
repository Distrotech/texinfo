* release <nowiki>[</nowiki>-d<nowiki>]</nowiki> directories&hellip;

* Requires: Working directory.

* Changes: Working directory, history log.

This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
&lsquo;<code>cvs checkout</code>&rsquo;.  Since <small>CVS</small> doesn&rsquo;t lock files, it
isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the <small>CVS</small> history
file (see [[cvs: The history file#The history file|history file]]) that you&rsquo;ve abandoned your
checkout.

Use &lsquo;<code>cvs release</code>&rsquo; to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a <small>CVS</small> working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

If all these conditions are true, &lsquo;<code>cvs release</code>&rsquo;
leaves a record of its execution (attesting to your
intentionally abandoning your checkout) in the <small>CVS</small>
history log.
