==== release options ====

<p>The <code>release</code> command supports one command option:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-d</code></dt>
<dd><p>Delete your working copy of the file if the release
succeeds.  If this flag is not given your files will
remain in your working directory.
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:  The <code>release</code> command deletes
all directories and files recursively.  This
has the very serious side-effect that any directory
that you have created inside your checked-out sources,
and not added to the repository (using the <code>add</code>
command; see [cvs: Adding files to a directory#Adding-files Adding files]) will be silently deleted&mdash;even
if it is non-empty!</strong>
