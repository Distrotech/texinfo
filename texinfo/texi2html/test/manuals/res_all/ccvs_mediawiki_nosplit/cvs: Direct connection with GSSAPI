GSSAPI is a generic interface to network security
systems such as Kerberos 5.
If you have a working GSSAPI library, you can have
<small>CVS</small> connect via a direct <small>TCP</small> connection,
authenticating with GSSAPI.

To do this, <small>CVS</small> needs to be compiled with GSSAPI
support; when configuring <small>CVS</small> it tries to detect
whether GSSAPI libraries using kerberos version 5 are
present.  You can also use the &lsquo;<tt>--with-gssapi</tt>&rsquo;
flag to configure.

The connection is authenticated using GSSAPI, but the
message stream is ''not'' authenticated by default.
You must use the <code>-a</code> global option to request
stream authentication.

The data transmitted is ''not'' encrypted by
default.  Encryption support must be compiled into both
the client and the server; use the
&lsquo;<tt>--enable-encrypt</tt>&rsquo; configure option to turn it on.
You must then use the <code>-x</code> global option to
request encryption.

GSSAPI connections are handled on the server side by
the same server which handles the password
authentication server; see [[cvs: Setting up the server for password authentication#Setting up the server for password authentication|Password authentication server]].  If you are using a GSSAPI mechanism such as
Kerberos which provides for strong authentication, you
will probably want to disable the ability to
authenticate via cleartext passwords.  To do so, create
an empty &lsquo;<tt>CVSROOT/passwd</tt>&rsquo; password file, and set
<code>SystemAuth=no</code> in the config file
(see [[cvs: The CVSROOT%47config configuration file#The CVSROOT/config configuration file|config]]).

The GSSAPI server uses a principal name of
cvs/<var>hostname</var>, where <var>hostname</var> is the
canonical name of the server host.  You will have to
set this up as required by your GSSAPI mechanism.

To connect using GSSAPI, use &lsquo;<code>:gserver:</code>&rsquo;.  For
example,

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 cvs -d :gserver:faun.example.org:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</div>
</td></tr></table>
