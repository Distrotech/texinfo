==== rdiff examples ====

Suppose you receive mail from <tt>foo@example.net</tt> asking for an
update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You
have no such patches on hand, but with <small>CVS</small> that can
easily be fixed with a command such as this:

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
 $$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@example.net
</div>
</td></tr></table>

Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch
called &lsquo;<code>R_1_3fix</code>&rsquo; for bugfixes.  &lsquo;<code>R_1_3_1</code>&rsquo;
corresponds to release 1.3.1, which was made some time
ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has been
done on the branch.  This command can be used:

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
 cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
 File ChangeLog,v changed from revision 1.52.2.5 to 1.52.2.6
 File foo.c,v changed from revision 1.52.2.3 to 1.52.2.4
 File bar.h,v changed from revision 1.29.2.1 to 1.2
</div>
</td></tr></table>
