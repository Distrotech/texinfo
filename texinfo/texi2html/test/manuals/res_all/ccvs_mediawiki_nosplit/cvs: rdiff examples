<p>Suppose you receive mail from <tt>foo@example.net</tt> asking for an
update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You
have no such patches on hand, but with <small>CVS</small> that can
easily be fixed with a command such as this:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
$$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@example.net
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch
called &lsquo;<samp>R_1_3fix</samp>&rsquo; for bugfixes.  &lsquo;<samp>R_1_3_1</samp>&rsquo;
corresponds to release 1.3.1, which was made some time
ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has been
done on the branch.  This command can be used:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
