<div id="Moving-the-history-file"></div>
==== Moving the history file ====

This method is more dangerous, since it involves moving
files inside the repository.  Read this entire section
before trying it out!

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cd $CVSROOT/<var>dir</var>
 $ mv <var>old</var>,v <var>new</var>,v
</div>

Advantages:


* The log of changes is maintained intact.


* The revision numbers are not affected.

Disadvantages:


* Old releases cannot easily be fetched from the repository.  (The file will show up as <var>new</var> even in revisions from the time before it was renamed).


* There is no log information of when the file was renamed.


* Nasty things might happen if someone accesses the history file while you are moving it.  Make sure no one else runs any of the <small>CVS</small> commands while you move it.
