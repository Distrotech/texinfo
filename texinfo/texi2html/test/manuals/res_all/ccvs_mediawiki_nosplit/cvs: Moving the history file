<div id="Moving-the-history-file"></div>
==== Moving the history file ====

<p>This method is more dangerous, since it involves moving
files inside the repository.  Read this entire section
before trying it out!
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 $ cd $CVSROOT/<var>dir</var>
 $ mv <var>old</var>,v <var>new</var>,v
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The log of changes is maintained intact.

</li><li>
The revision numbers are not affected.
</li></ul>

<p>Disadvantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Old releases cannot easily be fetched from the
repository.  (The file will show up as <var>new</var> even
in revisions from the time before it was renamed).

</li><li>
There is no log information of when the file was renamed.

</li><li>
Nasty things might happen if someone accesses the history file
while you are moving it.  Make sure no one else runs any of the <small>CVS</small>
commands while you move it.
</li></ul>
