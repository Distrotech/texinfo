The following line produces a Unidiff (&lsquo;<code>-u</code>&rsquo; flag)
between revision 1.14 and 1.19 of
&lsquo;<tt>backend.c</tt>&rsquo;.  Due to the &lsquo;<code>-kk</code>&rsquo; flag no
keywords are substituted, so differences that only depend
on keyword substitution are ignored.

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c
</div>

Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a
set of files tagged RELEASE_1_0.  To see what has
happened on that branch, the following can be used:

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1
</div>

A command like this can be used to produce a context
diff between two releases:

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &gt; diffs
</div>

If you are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the following
just before you commit your changes may help you write
the ChangeLog entry.  All local modifications that have
not yet been committed will be printed.

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cvs diff -u | less
</div>
