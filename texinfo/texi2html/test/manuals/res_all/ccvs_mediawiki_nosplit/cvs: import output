==== import output ====

<code>import</code> keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line
for each file, preceded by one character indicating the status of the file:

;<code>U <var>file</var></code>
: The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

;<code>N <var>file</var></code>
: The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

;<code>C <var>file</var></code>
: The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified; you will have to merge the changes.

;<code>I <var>file</var></code>
: The file is being ignored (see [[cvs: Ignoring files via cvsignore#Ignoring files via cvsignore|cvsignore]]).

<div id="index-Symbolic-link_002c-importing"></div>
<div id="index-Link_002c-symbolic_002c-importing"></div>
;<code>L <var>file</var></code>
: The file is a symbolic link; <code>cvs import</code> ignores symbolic links. People periodically suggest that this behavior should be changed, but if there is a consensus on what it should be changed to, it is not apparent. (Various options in the &lsquo;<tt>modules</tt>&rsquo; file can be used to recreate symbolic links on checkout, update, etc.; see [[cvs: The modules file#The modules file|modules]].)
