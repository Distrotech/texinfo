<dd><p>There exists a newer revision of this file in the
repository, and you have not modified your local copy
of the file (&lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>P</samp>&rsquo; mean the same thing).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>A <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The file has been added to your private copy of the

see [[cvs: Ignoring files via cvsignore#Ignoring files via cvsignore|cvsignore]]).  If you remove your working
sources, this file will be lost.
