== Revisions ==

For many uses of <small>CVS</small>, one doesn&rsquo;t need to worry
too much about revision numbers; <small>CVS</small> assigns
numbers such as <code>1.1</code>, <code>1.2</code>, and so on, and
that is all one needs to know.  However, some people
prefer to have more knowledge and control concerning
how <small>CVS</small> assigns revision numbers.

If one wants to keep track of a set of revisions
involving more than one file, such as which revisions
went into a particular release, one uses a <em>tag</em>,
which is a symbolic revision which can be assigned to a
numeric revision in each file.
