==== rdiff options ====

These standard options are supported by <code>rdiff</code>
(see [[cvs: Common command options#Common command options|Common options]], for a complete description of
them):

;<code>-D <var>date</var></code>
: Use the most recent revision no later than <var>date</var>.

;<code>-f</code>
: If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

;<code>-l</code>
: Local; don&rsquo;t descend subdirectories.

;<code>-R</code>
: Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

;<code>-r <var>tag</var></code>
: Use revision <var>tag</var>.

In addition to the above, these options are available:

;<code>-c</code>
: Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.

;<code>-s</code>
: Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The summary includes information about files that were changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to the standard output device.  This is useful for finding out, for example, which files have changed between two dates or revisions.

;<code>-t</code>
: A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output device.  This is most useful for seeing what the last change to a file was.

;<code>-u</code>
: Use the unidiff format for the context diffs. Remember that old versions of the <code>patch</code> program can&rsquo;t handle the unidiff format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net you should probably not use &lsquo;<code>-u</code>&rsquo;.

;<code>-V <var>vn</var></code>
: Expand keywords according to the rules current in <small>RCS</small> version <var>vn</var> (the expansion format changed with <small>RCS</small> version 5).  Note that this option is no longer accepted.  <small>CVS</small> will always expand keywords the way that <small>RCS</small> version 5 does.
