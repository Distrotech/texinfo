==== Direct connection with kerberos ====

<div id="index-Kerberos_002c-using-_003akserver_003a"></div>
<div id="index-Security_002c-kerberos"></div>
<div id="index-_003akserver_003a_002c-setting-up"></div>
<p>The easiest way to use kerberos is to use the kerberos
<code>rsh</code>, as described in [[cvs: Connecting with rsh#Connecting with rsh|Connecting via rsh]].
The main disadvantage of using rsh is that all the data
needs to pass through additional programs, so it may be
slower.  So if you have kerberos installed you can
connect via a direct <small>TCP</small> connection,
authenticating with kerberos.
</p>
<p>This section concerns the kerberos network security
system, version 4.  Kerberos version 5 is supported via
the GSSAPI generic network security interface, as
described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>To do this, <small>CVS</small> needs to be compiled with kerberos
support; when configuring <small>CVS</small> it tries to detect
whether kerberos is present or you can use the
&lsquo;<tt>--with-krb4</tt>&rsquo; flag to configure.
</p>
<p>The data transmitted is <em>not</em> encrypted by
default.  Encryption support must be compiled into both
the client and server; use the
&lsquo;<tt>--enable-encryption</tt>&rsquo; configure option to turn it
on.  You must then use the <code>-x</code> global option to
request encryption.
</p>
<div id="index-CVS_005fCLIENT_005fPORT"></div>
<p>You need to edit &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo; on the server
machine to run <code>cvs kserver</code>.  The client uses
port 1999 by default; if you want to use another port
specify it in the <code>CVSROOT</code> (see [[cvs: Remote repositories#Remote repositories|Remote repositories]])
or the <code>CVS_CLIENT_PORT</code> environment variable
(see [[cvs: All environment variables which affect CVS#All environment variables which affect CVS|Environment variables]]) on the client.
</p>
<div id="index-kinit"></div>
<p>When you want to use <small>CVS</small>, get a ticket in the
usual way (generally <code>kinit</code>); it must be a ticket
which allows you to log into the server machine.  Then
you are ready to go:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>cvs -d :kserver:faun.example.org:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Previous versions of <small>CVS</small> would fall back to a
connection via rsh; this version will not do so.
