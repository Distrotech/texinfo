==== history options ====

Several options (shown above as &lsquo;<code>-report</code>&rsquo;)  control  what
kind of report is generated:

;<code>-c</code>
: Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the repository was modified).

;<code>-e</code>
: Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to specifying &lsquo;<code>-x</code>&rsquo; with all record types.  Of course, &lsquo;<code>-e</code>&rsquo; will also include record types which are added in a future version of <small>CVS</small>; if you are writing a script which can only handle certain record types, you&rsquo;ll want to specify &lsquo;<code>-x</code>&rsquo;.

;<code>-m <var>module</var></code>
: Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use &lsquo;<code>-m</code>&rsquo; more than once on the command line.)

;<code>-o</code>
: Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.

;<code>-T</code>
: Report on all tags.

;<code>-x <var>type</var></code>
: Extract a particular set of record types <var>type</var> from the <small>CVS</small> history.  The types are indicated by single letters, which you may specify in combination.

: Certain commands have a single record type:

:;<code>F</code>
:: release
:;<code>O</code>
:: checkout
:;<code>E</code>
:: export
:;<code>T</code>
:: rtag

: One of four record types may result from an update:

:;<code>C</code>
:: A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring manual merging).
:;<code>G</code>
:: A merge was necessary and it succeeded.
:;<code>U</code>
:: A working file was copied from the repository.
:;<code>W</code>
:: The working copy of a file was deleted during update (because it was gone from the repository).

: One of three record types results from commit:

:;<code>A</code>
:: A file was added for the first time.
:;<code>M</code>
:: A file was modified.
:;<code>R</code>
:: A file was removed.

The options shown as &lsquo;<code>-flags</code>&rsquo; constrain or expand
the report without requiring option arguments:

;<code>-a</code>
: Show data for all users (the default is to show data only for the user executing <code>history</code>).

;<code>-l</code>
: Show last modification only.

;<code>-w</code>
: Show only the records for modifications done from the same working directory where <code>history</code> is executing.

The options shown as &lsquo;<code>-options <var>args</var></code>&rsquo; constrain the report
based on an argument:

;<code>-b <var>str</var></code>
: Show data back to a record containing  the  string <var>str</var>  in  either the module name, the file name, or the repository path.

;<code>-D <var>date</var></code>
: Show data since <var>date</var>.  This is slightly different from the normal use of &lsquo;<code>-D <var>date</var></code>&rsquo;, which selects the newest revision older than <var>date</var>.

;<code>-f <var>file</var></code>
: Show data for a particular file (you can specify several &lsquo;<code>-f</code>&rsquo; options on the same command line). This is equivalent to specifying the file on the command line.

;<code>-n <var>module</var></code>
: Show data for a particular module (you can specify several &lsquo;<code>-n</code>&rsquo; options on the same command line).

;<code>-p <var>repository</var></code>
: Show data for a particular source repository  (you can specify several &lsquo;<code>-p</code>&rsquo; options on the same command line).

;<code>-r <var>rev</var></code>
: Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag named <var>rev</var> appears in individual <small>RCS</small> files.  Each <small>RCS</small> file is searched for the revision or tag.

;<code>-t <var>tag</var></code>
: Show records since tag <var>tag</var> was last added to the history file.  This differs from the &lsquo;<code>-r</code>&rsquo; flag above in that it reads only the history file, not the <small>RCS</small> files, and is much faster.

;<code>-u <var>name</var></code>
: Show records for user <var>name</var>.

;<code>-z <var>timezone</var></code>
: Show times in the selected records using the specified time zone instead of UTC.
