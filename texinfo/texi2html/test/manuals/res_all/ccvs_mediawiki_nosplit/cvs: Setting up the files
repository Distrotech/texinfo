=== Setting up the files ===

The first step is to create the files inside the repository.  This can
be done in a couple of different ways.

<div class="menu-preformatted" style="font-family: serif">
 [[cvs: Creating a directory tree from a number of files#Creating a directory tree from a number of files|&bull; From files]]::                  This method is useful with old projects
                                 where files already exists.
 [[cvs: Creating Files From Other Version Control Systems#Creating Files From Other Version Control Systems|&bull; From other version control systems]]::  Old projects where you want to
                                         preserve history from another system.
 [[cvs: Creating a directory tree from scratch#Creating a directory tree from scratch|&bull; From scratch]]::                Creating a directory tree from scratch.
