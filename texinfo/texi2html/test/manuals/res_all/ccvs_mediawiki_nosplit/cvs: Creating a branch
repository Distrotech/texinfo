=== Creating a branch ===
<div id="index-Creating-a-branch"></div>
<div id="index-Branch_002c-creating-a"></div>
<div id="index-tag-_0028subcommand_0029_002c-creating-a-branch-using"></div>
<div id="index-rtag-_0028subcommand_0029_002c-creating-a-branch-using"></div>

<p>You can create a branch with <code>tag -b</code>; for
example, assuming you&rsquo;re in a working copy:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs tag -b rel-1-0-patches
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>


<p>This splits off a branch based on the current revisions
in the working copy, assigning that branch the name
&lsquo;<samp>rel-1-0-patches</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that branches get created
in the repository, not in the working copy.  Creating a
branch based on current revisions, as the above example
does, will <em>not</em> automatically switch the working
copy to be on the new branch.  For information on how
to do that, see [cvs: Accessing branches#Accessing-branches Accessing branches].
</p>
<p>You can also create a branch without reference to any
working copy, by using <code>rtag</code>:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs rtag -b -r rel-1-0 rel-1-0-patches tc
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>&lsquo;<samp>-r rel-1-0</samp>&rsquo; says that this branch should be
rooted at the revision that
corresponds to the tag &lsquo;<samp>rel-1-0</samp>&rsquo;.  It need not
be the most recent revision &ndash; it&rsquo;s often useful to
split a branch off an old revision (for example, when
fixing a bug in a past release otherwise known to be
stable).
</p>
<p>As with &lsquo;<samp>tag</samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp>-b</samp>&rsquo; flag tells
<code>rtag</code> to create a branch (rather than just a
symbolic revision name).  Note that the numeric
revision number that matches &lsquo;<samp>rel-1-0</samp>&rsquo; will
probably be different from file to file.
</p>
<p>So, the full effect of the command is to create a new
branch &ndash; named &lsquo;<samp>rel-1-0-patches</samp>&rsquo; &ndash; in module
&lsquo;<samp>tc</samp>&rsquo;, rooted in the revision tree at the point tagged
by &lsquo;<samp>rel-1-0</samp>&rsquo;.
