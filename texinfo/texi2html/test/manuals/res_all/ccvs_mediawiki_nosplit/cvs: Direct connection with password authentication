==== Direct connection with password authentication ====

The <small>CVS</small> client can also connect to the server
using a password protocol.  This is particularly useful
if using <code>rsh</code> is not feasible (for example,
the server is behind a firewall), and Kerberos also is
not available.

To use this method, it is necessary to make
some adjustments on both the server and client sides.
