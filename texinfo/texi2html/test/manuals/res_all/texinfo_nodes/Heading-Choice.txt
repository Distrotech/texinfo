E.2 Specifying the Type of Heading
==================================

TeX does not begin to generate page headings for a standard Texinfo
file until it reaches the @end titlepage command.  Thus, the
title and copyright pages are not numbered.  The @end
titlepage command causes TeX to begin to generate page headings
according to a standard format specified by the
@setchapternewpage command that precedes the
@titlepage section.

There are four possibilities:

No @setchapternewpage command
Cause TeX to specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters
on new pages. This is the same as @setchapternewpage on.

@setchapternewpage on
Specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters on new pages.

@setchapternewpage off
Cause TeX to start a new chapter on the same page as the last page of
the preceding chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also
cause TeX to typeset for single-sided printing.  (You can override
the headers format with the @headings double command; see
The @headings Command.)

@setchapternewpage odd
Specify the double-sided heading format, with chapters on new pages.

Texinfo lacks an @setchapternewpage even command.
