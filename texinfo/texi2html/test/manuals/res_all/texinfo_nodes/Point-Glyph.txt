13.9.7 @point{} (-!-): Indicating Point in a Buffer
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you need to show an example of text in an Emacs buffer.  In
such examples, the convention is to include the entire contents of the
buffer in question between two lines of dashes containing the buffer
name.

You can use the `@point{}' command to show the location of point
in the text in the buffer.  (The symbol for point, of course, is not
part of the text in the buffer; it indicates the place between
two characters where point is located.)

The @point{} command is displayed as `-!-' in Info
and as a small five pointed star in the printed output.

The following example shows the contents of buffer `foo' before
and after evaluating a Lisp command to insert the word changed.

---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the -!-contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------


(insert "changed ")
     => nil
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the changed -!-contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------


In a Texinfo source file, the example is written like this:

@example
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the @point{}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

(insert "changed ")
     @result{} nil
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the changed @point{}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
@end example
