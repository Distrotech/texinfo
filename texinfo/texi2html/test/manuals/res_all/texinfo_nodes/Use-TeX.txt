19.1 Use TeX
============

The typesetting program called TeX is used for formatting a Texinfo
file.  TeX is a very powerful typesetting program and, if used correctly,
does an exceptionally good job.  (See How to Obtain TeX, for information on how to obtain TeX.)

The standalone makeinfo program and Emacs functions
texinfo-format-region and texinfo-format-buffer commands
read the very same @-commands in the Texinfo file as does TeX, but
process them differently to make an Info file (see Creating an Info File).
