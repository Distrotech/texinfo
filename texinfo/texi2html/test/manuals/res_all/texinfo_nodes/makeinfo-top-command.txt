6.3.6 The @top Sectioning Command
---------------------------------

A special sectioning command, @top should be used with the
@node Top line.  The @top sectioning command tells
makeinfo that it marks the `Top' node in the file.  It provides
the information that makeinfo needs to insert node pointers
automatically.  Write the @top command at the beginning of the
line immediately following the @node Top line.  Write the title
on the remaining part of the same line as the @top command.

In Info, the @top sectioning command causes the title to appear
on a line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted underneath, as
other sectioning commands do.

In TeX and texinfo-format-buffer, the @top
sectioning command is merely a synonym for @unnumbered.
Neither of these formatters require an @top command, and do
nothing special with it.  You can use @chapter or
@unnumbered after the @node Top line when you use
these formatters.  Also, you can use @chapter or
@unnumbered when you use the Texinfo updating commands to
create or update pointers and menus.

Thus, in practice, a Top node starts like this:

@node Top
@top Your Manual Title
