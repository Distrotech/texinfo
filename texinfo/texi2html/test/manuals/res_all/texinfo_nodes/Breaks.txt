14 Making and Preventing Breaks
*******************************

Usually, a Texinfo file is processed both by TeX and by one of the
Info formatting commands.  Line, paragraph, or page breaks sometimes
occur in the `wrong' place in one or other form of output.  You must
ensure that text looks right both in the printed manual and in the
Info file.

For example, in a printed manual, page breaks may occur awkwardly in
the middle of an example; to prevent this, you can hold text together
using a grouping command that keeps the text from being split across
two pages.  Conversely, you may want to force a page break where none
would occur normally.  Fortunately, problems like these do not often
arise.  When they do, use the break, break prevention, or pagination
commands.
