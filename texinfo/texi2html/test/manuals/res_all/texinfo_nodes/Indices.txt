12 Indices
**********

Using Texinfo, you can generate indices without having to sort and
collate entries manually.  In an index, the entries are listed in
alphabetical order, together with information on how to find the
discussion of each entry.  In a printed manual, this information
consists of page numbers.  In an Info file, this information is a menu
entry leading to the first node referenced.

Texinfo provides several predefined kinds of index: an index
for functions, an index for variables, an index for concepts, and so
on.  You can combine indices or use them for other than their
canonical purpose.  If you wish, you can define your own indices.
