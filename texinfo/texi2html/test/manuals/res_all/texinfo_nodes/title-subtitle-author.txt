3.4.3 @title, @subtitle, and @author
------------------------------------

You can use the @title, @subtitle, and @author
commands to create a title page in which the vertical and horizontal
spacing is done for you automatically.  This contrasts with the method
described in the previous section, in which the @sp command is
needed to adjust vertical spacing.

Write the @title, @subtitle, or @author
commands at the beginning of a line followed by the title, subtitle,
or author.

The @title command produces a line in which the title is set
flush to the left-hand side of the page in a larger than normal font.
The title is underlined with a black rule.  Only a single line is
allowed; the @* command may not be used to break the title into
two lines.  To handle very long titles, you may find it profitable to
use both @title and @titlefont; see the final example in
this section.

The @subtitle command sets subtitles in a normal-sized font
flush to the right-hand side of the page.

The @author command sets the names of the author or authors in
a middle-sized font flush to the left-hand side of the page on a line
near the bottom of the title page.  The names are underlined with a
black rule that is thinner than the rule that underlines the title.
(The black rule only occurs if the @author command line is
followed by an @page command line.)

There are two ways to use the @author command: you can write
the name or names on the remaining part of the line that starts with
an @author command:

@author by Jane Smith and John Doe

or you can write the names one above each other by using two (or more)
@author commands:

@author Jane Smith
@author John Doe

(Only the bottom name is underlined with a black rule.)

A template for this method looks like this:

@titlepage
@title name-of-manual-when-printed
@subtitle subtitle-if-any
@subtitle second-subtitle
@author author
@page
...
@end titlepage

You may also combine the @titlefont method described in the
previous section and @title method described in this one.  This
may be useful if you have a very long title.  Here is a real-life example:

@titlepage
@titlefont{GNU Software}
@sp 1
@title for MS-Windows and MS-DOS
@subtitle Edition @value{e} for Release @value{cde}
@author by Daniel Hagerty, Melissa Weisshaus
@author and Eli Zaretskii

(The use of @value here is explained in value Example.
