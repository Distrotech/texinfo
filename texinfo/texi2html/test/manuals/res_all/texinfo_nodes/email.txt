9.1.15 @email{email-address[, displayed-text]}
----------------------------------------------

Use the @email command to indicate an electronic mail address.
It takes one mandatory argument, the address, and one optional argument, the
text to display (the default is the address itself).

In Info and TeX, the address is shown in angle brackets, preceded by
the text to display if any.  In HTML output, @email produces a
`mailto' link that usually brings up a mail composition window.
For example:

Send bug reports to @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org},
suggestions to the @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org, same place}.
produces
Send bug reports to <mailto:bug-texinfo@gnu.org>,
suggestions to the same place <mailto:bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.
