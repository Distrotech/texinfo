10.6 @lisp: Marking a Lisp Example
==================================

The @lisp command is used for Lisp code.  It is synonymous
with the @example command.

This is an example of text written between an
@lisp command and an @end lisp command.

Use @lisp instead of @example to preserve information
regarding the nature of the example.  This is useful, for example, if
you write a function that evaluates only and all the Lisp code in a
Texinfo file.  Then you can use the Texinfo file as a Lisp
library.(7)

Mark the end of @lisp with @end lisp on a line by
itself.
