19 Formatting and Printing Hardcopy
***********************************

There are three major shell commands for making a printed manual from a
Texinfo file: one for converting the Texinfo file into a file that will be
printed, a second for sorting indices, and a third for printing the
formatted document.  When you use the shell commands, you can either
work directly in the operating system shell or work within a shell
inside GNU Emacs.

If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use commands provided by Texinfo
mode instead of shell commands.  In addition to the three commands to
format a file, sort the indices, and print the result, Texinfo mode
offers key bindings for commands to recenter the output buffer, show the
print queue, and delete a job from the print queue.
