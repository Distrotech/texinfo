7.3 Less Cluttered Menu Entry
=============================

When the menu entry name and node name are the same, you can write
the name immediately after the asterisk and space at the beginning of
the line and follow the name with two colons.

For example, write

* Name::                                    description

instead of

* Name: Name.                               description

You should use the node name for the menu entry name whenever possible,
since it reduces visual clutter in the menu.
