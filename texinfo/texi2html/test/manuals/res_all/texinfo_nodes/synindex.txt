12.4.2 @synindex
----------------

The @synindex command is nearly the same as the
@syncodeindex command, except that it does not put the
`from' index  entries into the @code font; rather it puts
them in the roman font.  Thus, you use @synindex when you
merge a concept index into a function index.

See Printing Indices & Menus, for information about printing an index
at the end of a book or creating an index menu in an Info file.
