11.3.2 @itemx
-------------

Use the @itemx command inside a table when you have two or more
first column entries for the same item, each of which should appear on a
line of its own.  Use @itemx for all but the first entry;
@itemx should always follow an @item command.  The
@itemx command works exactly like @item except that it
does not generate extra vertical space above the first column text.

For example,

@table @code
@item upcase
@itemx downcase
These two functions accept a character or a string as
argument, and return the corresponding upper case (lower
case) character or string.
@end table

This produces:

upcase
downcase
These two functions accept a character or a string as
argument, and return the corresponding upper case (lower
case) character or string.

(Note also that this example illustrates multi-line supporting text in
a two-column table.)
