F.5.3 Tagifying a File
----------------------

After creating an unsplit Info file, you must create a tag table for
it.  Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and type:

M-x Info-tagify

(Note the upper case `I' in Info-tagify.)  This creates an
Info file with a tag table that you can validate.

The third step is to validate the Info file:

M-x Info-validate

(Note the upper case `I' in Info-validate.)
In brief, the steps are:

C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer
M-x Info-tagify
M-x Info-validate

After you have validated the node structure, you can rerun
texinfo-format-buffer in the normal way so it will construct a
tag table and split the file automatically, or you can make the tag
table and split the file manually.
