9.1.14 @url{uniform-resource-locator}
-------------------------------------

Use the @url command to indicate a uniform resource locator on
the World Wide Web.  This is analogous to @file, @var,
etc., and is purely for markup purposes.  It does not produce a link you
can follow in HTML output (use the @uref command for that,
see @uref).  It is useful for url's which do
not actually exist.  For example:

For example, the url might be @url{http://example.org/path}.

which produces:

For example, the url might be <http://example.org/path>.
