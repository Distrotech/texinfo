8.5 @ref
========

@ref is nearly the same as @xref except that it does
not generate a `See' in the printed output, just the reference itself.
This makes it useful as the last part of a sentence.

For example,

For more information, see @ref{Hurricanes}.

produces

For more information, see *Note Hurricanes::.

and

For more information, see Section 8.2 [Hurricanes], page 123.

The @ref command sometimes leads writers to express themselves
in a manner that is suitable for a printed manual but looks awkward
in the Info format.  Bear in mind that your audience will be using
both the printed and the Info format.

For example,

Sea surges are described in @ref{Hurricanes}.

produces

Sea surges are described in Section 6.7 [Hurricanes], page 72.

in a printed document, and the following in Info:

Sea surges are described in *Note Hurricanes::.

Caution: You must write a period, comma, or right
parenthesis immediately after an @ref command with two or more
arguments.  Otherwise, Info will not find the end of the cross reference
entry and its attempt to follow the cross reference will fail.  As a
general rule, you should write a period or comma after every
@ref command.  This looks best in both the printed and the Info
output.
