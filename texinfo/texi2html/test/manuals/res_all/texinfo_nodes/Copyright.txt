3.4.4 Copyright Page
--------------------

By international treaty, the copyright notice for a book must be either
on the title page or on the back of the title page.  When the copyright
notice is on the back of the title page, that page is customarily not
numbered.  Therefore, in Texinfo, the information on the copyright page
should be within @titlepage and @end titlepage
commands.

Use the @page command to cause a page break.  To push the
copyright notice and the other text on the copyright page towards the
bottom of the page, use the following incantantion after @page:

@vskip 0pt plus 1filll

This is a TeX command that is not supported by the Info formatting
commands.  The @vskip command inserts whitespace.  The `0pt
plus 1filll' means to put in zero points of mandatory whitespace, and as
much optional whitespace as needed to push the following text to the
bottom of the page.  Note the use of three `l's in the word
`filll'; this is correct.

To insert the copyright text itself, write @insertcopying
next (see Document Permissions):

@insertcopying

Follow the copying text by the publisher, ISBN numbers, cover art
credits, and other such information.

Here is an example putting all this together:

@titlepage

@page
@vskip 0pt plus 1filll

@end titlepage
