5.6 @majorheading, @chapheading
===============================

The @majorheading and @chapheading commands put
chapter-like headings in the body of a document.

However, neither command causes TeX to produce a numbered heading
or an entry in the table of contents; and neither command causes
TeX to start a new page in a printed manual.

In TeX, an @majorheading command generates a larger vertical
whitespace before the heading than an @chapheading command but
is otherwise the same.

In Info,
the @majorheading and
@chapheading commands are equivalent to
@chapter: the title is printed on a line by itself with a line
of asterisks underneath.  (See @chapter.)
