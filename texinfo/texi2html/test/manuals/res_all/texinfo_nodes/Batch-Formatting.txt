20.1.7 Batch Formatting
-----------------------

You can format Texinfo files for Info using batch-texinfo-format
and Emacs Batch mode.  You can run Emacs in Batch mode from any shell,
including a shell inside of Emacs.  (See (emacs)Command Switches section `Command Line Switches and Arguments' in The GNU Emacs Manual.)

Here is a shell command to format all the files that end in
`.texinfo' in the current directory:

emacs -batch -funcall batch-texinfo-format *.texinfo

Emacs processes all the files listed on the command line, even if an
error occurs while attempting to format some of them.

Run batch-texinfo-format only with Emacs in Batch mode as shown;
it is not interactive.  It kills the Batch mode Emacs on completion.

batch-texinfo-format is convenient if you lack makeinfo
and want to format several Texinfo files at once.  When you use Batch
mode, you create a new Emacs process.  This frees your current Emacs, so
you can continue working in it.  (When you run
texinfo-format-region or texinfo-format-buffer, you cannot
use that Emacs for anything else until the command finishes.)
