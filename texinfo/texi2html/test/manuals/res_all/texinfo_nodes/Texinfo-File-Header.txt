3.2 Texinfo File Header
=======================

Texinfo files start with at least three lines that provide Info and
TeX with necessary information.  These are the \input texinfo
line, the @settitle line, and the @setfilename line.

Also, if you want to format just part of the Texinfo file, you must
write the @settitle and @setfilename lines between
start-of-header and end-of-header lines.  The start- and end-of-header
lines are optional, but they do no harm, so you might as well always
include them.

Any command that affects document formatting as a whole makes sense to
include in the header.  @synindex (see synindex), for
instance, is another command often included in the header.  See GNU Sample Texts, for complete sample texts.

Thus, the beginning of a Texinfo file generally looks like this:

\input texinfo   @c -*-texinfo-*-
@c %**start of header
@setfilename sample.info
@settitle Sample Manual 1.0
@c %**end of header

* First Line::                  The first line of a Texinfo file.
* Start of Header::             Formatting a region requires this.
* setfilename::                 Tell Info the name of the Info file.
* settitle::                    Create a title for the printed work.
* End of Header::               Formatting a region requires this.
