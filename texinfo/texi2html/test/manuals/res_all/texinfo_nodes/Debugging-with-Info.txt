F.1 Catching Errors with Info Formatting
========================================

After you have written part of a Texinfo file, you can use the
texinfo-format-region or the makeinfo-region command to
see whether the region formats properly.

Most likely, however, you are reading this section because for some
reason you cannot use the makeinfo-region command; therefore, the
rest of this section presumes that you are using
texinfo-format-region.

If you have made a mistake with an @-command,
texinfo-format-region will stop processing at or after the
error and display an error message.  To see where in the buffer the
error occurred, switch to the `*Info Region*' buffer; the cursor
will be in a position that is after the location of the error.  Also,
the text will not be formatted after the place where the error
occurred (or more precisely, where it was detected).

For example, if you accidentally end a menu with the command @end
menus with an `s' on the end, instead of with @end menu, you
will see an error message that says:

@end menus is not handled by texinfo

The cursor will stop at the point in the buffer where the error
occurs, or not long after it.  The buffer will look like this:

---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
* Menu:

* Using texinfo-show-structure::  How to use
                                  `texinfo-show-structure'
                                  to catch mistakes.
* Running Info-Validate::         How to check for
                                  unreferenced nodes.
@end menus
-!-
---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------

The texinfo-format-region command sometimes provides slightly
odd error messages.  For example, the following cross reference fails to format:

(@xref{Catching Mistakes, for more info.)

In this case, texinfo-format-region detects the missing closing
brace but displays a message that says `Unbalanced parentheses'
rather than `Unbalanced braces'.  This is because the formatting
command looks for mismatches between braces as if they were
parentheses.

Sometimes texinfo-format-region fails to detect mistakes.  For
example, in the following, the closing brace is swapped with the
closing parenthesis:

(@xref{Catching Mistakes), for more info.}

Formatting produces:
(*Note for more info.: Catching Mistakes)

The only way for you to detect this error is to realize that the
reference should have looked like this:

(*Note Catching Mistakes::, for more info.)

Incidentally, if you are reading this node in Info and type f
<RET> (Info-follow-reference), you will generate an error
message that says:

No such node: "Catching Mistakes) The only way ...

This is because Info perceives the example of the error as the first
cross reference in this node and if you type a <RET> immediately
after typing the Info f command, Info will attempt to go to the
referenced node.  If you type f catch <TAB> <RET>, Info
will complete the node name of the correctly written example and take
you to the `Catching Mistakes' node.  (If you try this, you can return
from the `Catching Mistakes' node by typing l
(Info-last).)
