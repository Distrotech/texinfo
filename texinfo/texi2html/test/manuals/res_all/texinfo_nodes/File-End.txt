4.3 @bye File Ending
====================

An @bye command terminates TeX or Info formatting.  None of
the formatting commands reading anything following @bye.  The
@bye command should be on a line by itself.

If you wish, you may follow the @bye line with notes. These
notes will not be formatted and will not appear in either Info or a
printed manual; it is as if text after @bye were within
@ignore ... @end ignore.  Also, you may follow the
@bye line with a local variables list for Emacs.
See Using Local Variables and the Compile Command,
for more information.
