19.12 Printing on A4 Paper
==========================

You can tell TeX to format a document for printing on European size
A4 paper (or A5) with the @afourpaper (or @afivepaper)
command.  Write the command on a line by itself near the beginning of
the Texinfo file, before the title page.  For example, this is how you
would write the header for this manual:

\input texinfo    @c -*-texinfo-*-
@c %**start of header
@setfilename texinfo
@settitle Texinfo
@afourpaper
@c %**end of header

See Format with texi2dvi, and Preparing for TeX, for other ways to format for different paper sizes that do not
require changing the source file.

You may or may not prefer the formatting that results from the command
@afourlatex.  There's also @afourwide for A4 paper in
wide format.
