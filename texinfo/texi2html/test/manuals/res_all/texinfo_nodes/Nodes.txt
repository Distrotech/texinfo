6 Nodes
*******

Nodes are the primary segments of a Texinfo file.  They do not
themselves impose a hierarchical or any other kind of structure on a file.
Nodes contain node pointers that name other nodes, and can contain
menus which are lists of nodes.  In Info, the movement commands
can carry you to a pointed-to node or to a node listed in a menu.  Node
pointers and menus provide structure for Info files just as chapters,
sections, subsections, and the like, provide structure for printed
books.
