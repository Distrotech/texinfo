16.4.2 @ifset and @ifclear
--------------------------

When a flag is set, the Texinfo formatting commands format text
between subsequent pairs of @ifset flag and @end
ifset commands.  When the flag is cleared, the Texinfo formatting
commands do not format the text.  @ifclear operates
analogously.

Write the conditionally formatted text between @ifset flag
and @end ifset commands, like this:

@ifset flag
conditional-text
@end ifset

For example, you can create one document that has two variants, such as
a manual for a `large' and `small' model:

You can use this machine to dig up shrubs
without hurting them.

@set large

@ifset large
It can also dig up fully grown trees.
@end ifset

Remember to replant promptly ...

In the example, the formatting commands will format the text between
@ifset large and @end ifset because the large
flag is set.

When flag is cleared, the Texinfo formatting commands do
not format the text between @ifset flag and
@end ifset; that text is ignored and does not appear in either
printed or Info output.

For example, if you clear the flag of the preceding example by writing
an @clear large command after the @set large command
(but before the conditional text), then the Texinfo formatting commands
ignore the text between the @ifset large and @end ifset
commands.  In the formatted output, that text does not appear; in both
printed and Info output, you see only the lines that say, "You can use
this machine to dig up shrubs without hurting them.  Remember to replant
promptly ...".

If a flag is cleared with an @clear flag command, then
the formatting commands format text between subsequent pairs of
@ifclear and @end ifclear commands.  But if the flag
is set with @set flag, then the formatting commands do
not format text between an @ifclear and an @end
ifclear command; rather, they ignore that text.  An @ifclear
command looks like this:

@ifclear flag
