1.9 Six Parts of a Texinfo File
===============================

Generally, a Texinfo file contains more than the minimal beginning and
end described in the previous section--it usually contains the six
parts listed below.  These are described fully in the following sections.

1. Header
The Header names the file, tells TeX which definitions file to
use, and other such housekeeping tasks.

2. Summary and Copyright
The Summary and Copyright segment describes the document and
contains the copyright notice and copying permissions.  This is done
with the @copying command.

3. Title and Copyright
The Title and Copyright segment contains the title and copyright
pages for the printed manual.  The segment must be enclosed between
@titlepage and @end titlepage commands.  The title and
copyright page appear only in the printed manual.

4. `Top' Node and Master Menu
The `Top' node starts off the online output; it does not appear in the
printed manual.  We recommend including the copying permissions here as
well as the segments above.  And it contains at least a top-level menu
listing the chapters, and possibly a Master Menu listing all the
nodes in the entire document.

5. Body
The Body of the document is typically structured like a
traditional book or encyclopedia, but it may be free form.

6. End
The End segment contains commands for printing indices and
generating the table of contents, and the @bye command on a line
of its own.
