13.10.1 Footnote Commands
-------------------------

In Texinfo, footnotes are created with the @footnote command.
This command is followed immediately by a left brace, then by the text
of the footnote, and then by a terminating right brace.  Footnotes may
be of any length (they will be broken across pages if necessary), but
are usually short.  The template is:

ordinary text@footnote{text of footnote}

As shown here, the @footnote command should come right after the
text being footnoted, with no intervening space; otherwise, the footnote
marker might end up starting a line.

For example, this clause is followed by a sample footnote(9); in the Texinfo source, it looks like
this:

...a sample footnote@footnote{Here is the sample
footnote.}; in the Texinfo source...

As you can see, the source includes two punctuation marks next to each
other; in this case, `.};' is the sequence.  This is normal (the
first ends the footnote and the second belongs to the sentence being
footnoted), so don't worry that it looks odd.

In a printed manual or book, the reference mark for a footnote is a
small, superscripted number; the text of the footnote appears at the
bottom of the page, below a horizontal line.

In Info, the reference mark for a footnote is a pair of parentheses
with the footnote number between them, like this: `(1)'.  The
reference mark is followed by a cross-reference link to the footnote's
text.

In the HTML output, footnote references are marked with a small,
superscripted number which is rendered as a hypertext link to the
footnote text.

By the way, footnotes in the argument of an @item command for a
@table must be on the same line as the @item
(as usual).  See Two-column Tables.
