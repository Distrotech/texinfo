19.7 Using the Local Variables List
===================================

Yet another way to apply the TeX formatting command to a Texinfo file
is to put that command in a local variables list at the end of the
Texinfo file.  You can then specify the tex or texi2dvi
commands as a compile-command and have Emacs run it by typing
M-x compile.  This creates a special shell called the
`*compilation*' buffer in which Emacs runs the compile command.
For example, at the end of the `gdb.texinfo' file, after the
@bye, you could put the following:

Local Variables:
compile-command: "texi2dvi gdb.texinfo"
End:

This technique is most often used by programmers who also compile programs
this way; see Compilation in The GNU Emacs Manual.
