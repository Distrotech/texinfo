19.14 Cropmarks and Magnification
=================================
You can (attempt to) direct TeX to print cropmarks at the corners of
pages with the @cropmarks command.  Write the @cropmarks
command on a line by itself between @iftex and @end
iftex lines near the beginning of the Texinfo file, before the title
page, like this:

@iftex
@cropmarks
@end iftex

This command is mainly for printers that typeset several pages on one
sheet of film; but you can attempt to use it to mark the corners of a
book set to 7 by 9.25 inches with the @smallbook command.
(Printers will not produce cropmarks for regular sized output that is
printed on regular sized paper.)  Since different printing machines work
in different ways, you should explore the use of this command with a
spirit of adventure.  You may have to redefine the command in
`texinfo.tex'.

You can attempt to direct TeX to typeset pages larger or smaller than
usual with the \mag TeX command.  Everything that is typeset
is scaled proportionally larger or smaller.  (\mag stands for
"magnification".)  This is not a Texinfo @-command, but is a
plain TeX command that is prefixed with a backslash.  You have to
write this command between @tex and @end tex
(see Raw Formatter Commands).

Follow the \mag command with an `=' and then a number that
is 1000 times the magnification you desire.  For example, to print pages
at 1.2 normal size, write the following near the beginning of the
Texinfo file, before the title page:

@tex
\mag=1200
@end tex

With some printing technologies, you can print normal-sized copies that
look better than usual by giving a larger-than-normal master to your
print shop.  They do the reduction, thus effectively increasing the
resolution.

Depending on your system, DVI files prepared with a
nonstandard-\mag may not print or may print only with certain
magnifications.  Be prepared to experiment.
