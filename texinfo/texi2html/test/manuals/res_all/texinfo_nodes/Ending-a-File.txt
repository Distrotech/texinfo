4 Ending a Texinfo File
***********************

The end of a Texinfo file should include commands to create indices and
(perhaps) to generate both the full and summary tables of contents.
Finally, it must include the @bye command that marks the last
line to be processed.

For example:

@node Index
@unnumbered Index

@printindex cp

@shortcontents
@contents

@bye
