9.1.7 @env{environment-variable}
--------------------------------

Use the @env command to indicate environment variables, as used
by many operating systems, including GNU.  Do not use it for
metasyntactic variables; use @var instead (see the previous
section).

@env is equivalent to @code in its effects.
For example:

The @env{PATH} environment variable ...
produces
The PATH environment variable ...
