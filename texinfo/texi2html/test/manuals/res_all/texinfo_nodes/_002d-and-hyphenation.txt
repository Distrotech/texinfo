14.2 @- and @hyphenation: Helping TeX hyphenate
===============================================


Although TeX's hyphenation algorithm is generally pretty good, it
does miss useful hyphenation points from time to time.  (Or, far more
rarely, insert an incorrect hyphenation.)  So, for documents with an
unusual vocabulary or when fine-tuning for a printed edition, you may
wish to help TeX out.  Texinfo supports two commands for this:

@-
Insert a discretionary hyphen, i.e., a place where TeX can (but does
not have to) hyphenate.  This is especially useful when you notice an
overfull hbox is due to TeX missing a hyphenation (see Overfull hboxes).  TeX will not insert any hyphenation points itself into a
word containing @-.

@hyphenation{hy-phen-a-ted words}
Tell TeX how to hyphenate hy-phen-a-ted words.  As shown, you
put a `-' at each hyphenation point.  For example:
@hyphenation{man-u-script man-u-scripts}
TeX only uses the specified hyphenation points when the
words match exactly, so give all necessary variants.

Info output is not hyphenated, so these commands have no effect there.
