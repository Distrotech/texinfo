D.2 texinfo-multiple-files-update
=================================

GNU Emacs Texinfo mode provides the texinfo-multiple-files-update
command.  This command creates or updates `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of included files as well as those in the outer or overall
Texinfo file, and it creates or updates a main menu in the outer file.
Depending whether you call it with optional arguments, the command
updates only the pointers in the first @node line of the
included files or all of them:

M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called without any arguments:

-- Create or update the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers of the
first @node line in each file included in an outer or overall
Texinfo file.

-- Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer or
overall file.

-- Create or update a main menu in the outer file.

C-u M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called with C-u as a prefix argument:

-- Create or update pointers in the first @node line in each
included file.

-- Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer file.

-- Create and insert a master menu in the outer file.  The master menu
is made from all the menus in all the included files.

C-u 8 M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called with a numeric prefix argument, such as C-u 8:

-- Create or update all the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers
of all the included files.

-- Create or update all the menus of all the included
files.

-- Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer or
overall file.

-- And then create a master menu in the outer file.  This is similar to
invoking texinfo-master-menu with an argument when you are
working with just one file.

Note the use of the prefix argument in interactive use: with a regular
prefix argument, just C-u, the
texinfo-multiple-files-update command inserts a master menu;
with a numeric prefix argument, such as C-u 8, the command
updates every pointer and menu in all the files and then inserts a
master menu.
