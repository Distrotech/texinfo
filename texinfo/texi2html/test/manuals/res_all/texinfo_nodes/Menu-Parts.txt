7.2 The Parts of a Menu
=======================

A menu entry has three parts, only the second of which is required:

1. The menu entry name (optional).

2. The name of the node (required).

3. A description of the item (optional).

The template for a menu entry looks like this:

* menu-entry-name: node-name.   description

Follow the menu entry name with a single colon and follow the node name
with tab, comma, period, or newline.

In Info, a user selects a node with the m (Info-menu)
command.  The menu entry name is what the user types after the m
command.

The third part of a menu entry is a descriptive phrase or sentence.
Menu entry names and node names are often short; the description
explains to the reader what the node is about.  A useful description
complements the node name rather than repeats it.  The description,
which is optional, can spread over two or more lines; if it does, some
authors prefer to indent the second line while others prefer to align it
with the first (and all others).  It's up to you.
