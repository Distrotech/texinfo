Reference Syntax

What a Reference Looks Like and Requires
----------------------------------------

Most often, an Info cross reference looks like this:

*Note node-name::.

or like this

*Note cross-reference-name: node-name.

In TeX, a cross reference looks like this:

See Section section-number [node-name], page page.

or like this

See Section section-number [title-or-topic], page page.

The @xref command does not generate a period or comma to end
the cross reference in either the Info file or the printed output.
You must write that period or comma yourself; otherwise, Info will not
recognize the end of the reference.  (The @pxref command works
differently.  See @pxref.)

Please note: A period or comma must follow the closing
brace of an @xref.  It is required to terminate the cross
reference.  This period or comma will appear in the output, both in
the Info file and in the printed manual.

@xref must refer to an Info node by name.  Use @node
to define the node (see Writing a Node).

@xref is followed by several arguments inside braces, separated by
commas.  Whitespace before and after these commas is ignored.

A cross reference requires only the name of a node; but it may contain
up to four additional arguments.  Each of these variations produces a
cross reference that looks somewhat different.

Please note: Commas separate arguments in a cross reference;
avoid including them in the title or other part lest the formatters
mistake them for separators.
