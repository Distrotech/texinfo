8.3.1 @xref with One Argument
-----------------------------

The simplest form of @xref takes one argument, the name of
another node in the same Info file.    The Info formatters produce
output that the Info readers can use to jump to the reference; TeX
produces output that specifies the page and section number for you.

For example,

@xref{Tropical Storms}.

produces

*Note Tropical Storms::.

and

See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24.

(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
period.)

You can write a clause after the cross reference, like this:

@xref{Tropical Storms}, for more info.

which produces

*Note Tropical Storms::, for more info.

and

See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24, for more info.

(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
comma, and then by the clause, which is followed by a period.)
