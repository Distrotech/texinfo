13.4 Inserting Ellipsis and Bullets
===================================

An ellipsis (a line of dots) is not typeset as a string of
periods, so a special command is used for ellipsis in Texinfo.  The
@bullet command is special, too.  Each of these commands is
followed by a pair of braces, `{}', without any whitespace
between the name of the command and the braces.  (You need to use braces
with these commands because you can use them next to other text; without
the braces, the formatters would be confused.  See @-Command Syntax, for further information.)
