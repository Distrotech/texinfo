2 Using Texinfo Mode
********************

You may edit a Texinfo file with any text editor you choose.  A Texinfo
file is no different from any other ASCII file.  However, GNU Emacs
comes with a special mode, called Texinfo mode, that provides Emacs
commands and tools to help ease your work.

This chapter describes features of GNU Emacs' Texinfo mode but not any

manual straight through from the beginning, you may want to skim through
this chapter briefly and come back to it after reading succeeding
