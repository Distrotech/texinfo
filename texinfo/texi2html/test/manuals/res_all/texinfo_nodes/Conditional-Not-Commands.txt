16.2 Conditional Not Commands
=============================

You can specify text to be included in any output format other
than some given one with the @ifnot... commands:
@ifnothtml ... @end ifnothtml
@ifnotinfo ... @end ifnotinfo
@ifnotplaintext ... @end ifnotplaintext
@ifnottex ... @end ifnottex
(The @ifnot... command and the @end command must
appear on lines by themselves in your actual source file.)

If the output file is not being made for the given format, the
region is included.  Otherwise, it is ignored.

With one exception (for historical compatibility): @ifnotinfo
text is omitted for both Info and plain text output, not just Info.  To
specify text which appears only in Info and not in plain text, use
@ifnotplaintext, like this:

The regions delimited by these commands are ordinary Texinfo source as
with @iftex, not raw formatter source as with @tex
(see Raw Formatter Commands).
