1.10 A Short Sample Texinfo File
================================

Here is a very short but complete Texinfo file, in the six conventional
parts enumerated in the previous section, so you can see how Texinfo
source appears in practice.  The first three parts of the file, from
`\input texinfo' through to `@end titlepage', look more
intimidating than they are: most of the material is standard
boilerplate; when writing a manual, you simply change the names as
appropriate.

See Beginning a File, for full documentation on the commands listed
here.  See GNU Sample Texts, for the full texts to be used in GNU manuals.

In the following, the sample text is indented; comments on it are
not.  The complete file, without interspersed comments, is shown in
Short Sample Texinfo File.

Part 1: Header
--------------

The header does not appear in either the Info file or the
printed output.  It sets various parameters, including the
name of the Info file and the title used in the header.

\input texinfo   @c -*-texinfo-*-
@c %**start of header
@setfilename sample.info
@settitle Sample Manual 1.0
@c %**end of header

Part 2: Summary Description and Copyright
-----------------------------------------

A real manual includes more text here, according to the license under
which it is distributed.  See GNU Sample Texts.

@copying
This is a short example of a complete Texinfo file, version 1.0.

Copyright @copyright{} 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
@end copying

Part 3: Titlepage, Contents, Copyright
--------------------------------------

The titlepage segment does not appear in the online output, only in the
printed manual.  We use the @insertcopying command to
include the permission text from the previous section, instead of
writing it out again; it is output on the back of the title page.  The
@contents command generates a table of contents.

@titlepage
@title Sample Title

@c The following two commands start the copyright page.
@page
@vskip 0pt plus 1filll
@insertcopying
@end titlepage

@c Output the table of contents at the beginning.
@contents

Part 4: `Top' Node and Master Menu
----------------------------------

The `Top' node contains the master menu for the Info file.  Since a
printed manual uses a table of contents rather than a menu, the master
menu appears only in online output.  We also include the copying text
again for the benefit of online readers.  And since the copying text
begins with a brief description of the manual, no other text is needed.

@ifnottex
@node Top
@end ifnottex

@insertcopying

@menu
* First Chapter::    The first chapter is the
                       only chapter in this sample.
* Index::            Complete index.
@end menu


Part 5: The Body of the Document
--------------------------------

The body segment contains all the text of the document, but not the
indices or table of contents.  This example illustrates a node and a
chapter containing an enumerated list.

@node First Chapter
@chapter First Chapter

@cindex chapter, first

This is the first chapter.
@cindex index entry, another

Here is a numbered list.

@enumerate
@item
This is the first item.

@item
This is the second item.
@end enumerate


Part 6: The End of the Document
-------------------------------

The end segment contains commands for generating an index in a node and
unnumbered chapter of its own, and the @bye command that marks
the end of the document.

@node Index
@unnumbered Index

@printindex cp

@bye


Some Results
------------

Here is what the contents of the first chapter of the sample look like:


This is the first chapter.

Here is a numbered list.

1. This is the first item.

2. This is the second item.
