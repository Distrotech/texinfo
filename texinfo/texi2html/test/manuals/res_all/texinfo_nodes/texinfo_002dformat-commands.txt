20.1.6 The texinfo-format... Commands
-------------------------------------

In GNU Emacs in Texinfo mode, you can format part or all of a Texinfo
file with the texinfo-format-region command.  This formats the
current region and displays the formatted text in a temporary buffer
called `*Info Region*'.

Similarly, you can format a buffer with the
texinfo-format-buffer command.  This command creates a new
buffer and generates the Info file in it.  Typing C-x C-s will
save the Info file under the name specified by the
@setfilename line which must be near the beginning of the
Texinfo file.

C-c C-e C-r
texinfo-format-region
Format the current region for Info.

C-c C-e C-b
texinfo-format-buffer
Format the current buffer for Info.

The texinfo-format-region and texinfo-format-buffer
commands provide you with some error checking, and other functions can
provide you with further help in finding formatting errors.  These
procedures are described in an appendix; see Catching Mistakes.
However, the makeinfo program is often faster and
provides better error checking (see makeinfo in Emacs).
