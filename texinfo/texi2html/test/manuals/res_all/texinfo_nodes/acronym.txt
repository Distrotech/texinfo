9.1.13 @acronym{acronym}
------------------------

Use the @acronym command for abbreviations written in all
capital letters, such as `NASA'.  The abbreviation is given as
the single argument in braces, as in `@acronym{NASA}'.  As
a matter of style, or for particular abbreviations, you may prefer to
use periods, as in `@acronym{F.B.I.}'.

In TeX and HTML, the argument is printed in a slightly smaller font
size.  In Info or plain text output, this command changes nothing.
