10.3 @example: Example Text
===========================

The @example command is used to indicate an example that is
not part of the running text, such as computer input or output.

This is an example of text written between an
@example command
and an @end example command.
The text is indented but not filled.

In the printed manual, the text is typeset in a
fixed-width font, and extra spaces and blank lines are
significant.  In the Info file, an analogous result is
obtained by indenting each line with five spaces.

Write an @example command at the beginning of a line by itself.
Mark the end of the example
with an @end example command, also written at the beginning of a
line by itself.

For example,

@example
mv foo bar
@end example

produces

mv foo bar

The lines containing @example and @end example
will disappear from the output.
To make the output look good,
you should put a blank line before the
@example and another blank line after the @end example.
Note that blank lines inside the beginning
@example and the ending @end example will appear in
the output.

Caution: Do not use tabs in the lines of an example or anywhere
else in Texinfo (except in verbatim environments)!  The TeX
implementation of Texinfo treats tabs as single spaces, and that is not
what they look like.  (If necessary, in Emacs, you can use M-x
untabify to convert tabs in a region to multiple spaces.)

Examples are often, logically speaking, "in the middle" of a
paragraph, and the text that continues after an example should not be
indented.  The @noindent command prevents a piece of text from
being indented as if it were a new paragraph.
(See noindent.)

(The @code command is used for examples of code that are
embedded within sentences, not set off from preceding and following
text.  See @code.)
