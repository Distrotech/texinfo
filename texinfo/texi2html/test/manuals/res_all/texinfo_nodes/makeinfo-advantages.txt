20.1.1 makeinfo Preferred
-------------------------

The makeinfo utility creates an Info file from a Texinfo source
file more quickly than either of the Emacs formatting commands and
provides better error messages.  We recommend it.  makeinfo is a
C program that is independent of Emacs.  You do not need to run Emacs to
use makeinfo, which means you can use makeinfo on machines
that are too small to run Emacs.  You can run makeinfo in any one
of three ways: from an operating system shell, from a shell inside
Emacs, or by typing the C-c C-m C-r or the C-c C-m C-b
command in Texinfo mode in Emacs.


The texinfo-format-region and the texinfo-format-buffer
commands are useful if you cannot run makeinfo.  Also, in some
circumstances, they format short regions or buffers more quickly than
makeinfo.
