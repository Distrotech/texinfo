13.5 Inserting TeX and the Copyright Symbol
===========================================

The logo `TeX' is typeset in a special fashion and it needs an
@-command.  The copyright symbol, `(C)', is also special.
Each of these commands is followed by a pair of braces, `{}',
without any whitespace between the name of the command and the
braces.
