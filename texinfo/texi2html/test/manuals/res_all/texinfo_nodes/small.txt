10.7 @small... Block Commands
=============================

In addition to the regular @example and @lisp commands,
Texinfo has "small" example-style commands.  These are
@smalldisplay, @smallexample, @smallformat, and
@smalllisp.

In TeX, the @small... commands typeset text in a smaller
font than the non-small example commands.  Consequently, many examples
containing long lines fit on a page without needing to be shortened.

In Info, the @small... commands are equivalent to their
non-small companion commands.

Mark the end of an @small... block with a corresponding
@end small....  For example, pair @smallexample with
@end smallexample.

This is an example of text written between @smallexample and
@end smallexample.  In Info this text appears in its normal size;
but in a 7 by 9.25 inch manual, this text appears in a smaller font.

The @small... commands make it easier to prepare manuals
without forcing you to edit examples by hand to fit them onto narrower
pages.

As a general rule, a printed document looks better if you use only one
of (for example) @example or in @smallexample
consistently within a chapter.  Only occasionally should you mix the two
formats.

See Printing "Small" Books, for more information
about the @smallbook command.
