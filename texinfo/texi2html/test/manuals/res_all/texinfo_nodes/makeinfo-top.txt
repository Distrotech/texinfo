5.3 @top
========

The @top command is a special sectioning command that you use
only after an `@node Top' line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.
The @top command tells the makeinfo formatter which node
is the `Top' node, so it can use it as the root of the node tree if your
manual uses implicit pointers.  It has the same typesetting effect as
@unnumbered (see @unnumbered and @appendix).  For detailed information, see The @top Command.

The @top node and its menu (if any) is conventionally wrapped in
an @ifnottex conditional so that it will appear only in Info and
HTML output, not TeX.
