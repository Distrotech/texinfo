13.8 @math: Inserting Mathematical Expressions
==============================================

You can write a short mathematical expression with the @math
command.  Write the mathematical expression between braces, like this:

@math{(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2}

This produces the following in Info:

(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

Thus, the @math command has no effect on the Info output.

@math implies @tex.  This not only makes it possible to
write superscripts and subscripts (as in the above example), but also
allows you to use any of the plain TeX math control sequences.  It's
conventional to use `\' instead of `@' for these commands.
As in:
@math{\sin 2\pi \equiv \cos 3\pi}

which looks like the input in Info and HTML:
\sin 2\pi \equiv \cos 3\pi

Since `\' is an escape character inside @math, you can use
@\ to get a literal backslash (\\ will work in TeX,
but you'll get the literal `\\' in Info).  @\ is not
defined outside of @math, since a `\' ordinarily produces a
literal `\'.


For displayed equations, you must at present use TeX directly
(see Raw Formatter Commands).
