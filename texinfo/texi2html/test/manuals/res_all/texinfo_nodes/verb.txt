9.1.5 @verb{<char>text<char>}
-----------------------------

Use the @verb command to print a verbatim sequence of
characters.

Like LaTeX's \verb command, the verbatim text can be quoted using
any unique delimiter character.  Enclose the verbatim text, including the
delimiters, in braces.  Text is printed in a fixed-width font:

How many @verb{|@|}-escapes does one need to print this
@verb{.@a @b @c.} string or @verb{+@'e?`!`{}\+} this?

produces

How many @ -escapes does one need to print this
@a @b @c string or these @'e?`{}!`\ this?

This is in contrast to @samp (see the previous
section), whose argument is normal Texinfo text, where the characters
@{} are special; with @verb, nothing is special except
the delimiter character you choose.
