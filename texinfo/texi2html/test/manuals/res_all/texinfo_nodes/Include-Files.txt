Appendix D Include Files
************************

When TeX or an Info formatting command sees an @include
command in a Texinfo file, it processes the contents of the file named
by the command and incorporates them into the DVI or Info file being
created.  Index entries from the included file are incorporated into
the indices of the output file.

Include files let you keep a single large document as a collection of
conveniently small parts.
