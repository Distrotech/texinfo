14.4 @sp n: Insert Blank Lines
==============================

A line beginning with and containing only @sp n
generates n blank lines of space in both the printed manual and
the Info file.  @sp also forces a paragraph break.  For
example,

@sp 2

generates two blank lines.

The @sp command is most often used in the title page.
