14.6 @group: Prevent Page Breaks
================================

The @group command (on a line by itself) is used inside an
@example or similar construct to begin an unsplittable vertical
group, which will appear entirely on one page in the printed output.
The group is terminated by a line containing only @end group.
These two lines produce no output of their own, and in the Info file
output they have no effect at all.

Although @group would make sense conceptually in a wide
variety of contexts, its current implementation works reliably only
within @example and variants, and within @display,
@format, @flushleft and @flushright.
See Quotations and Examples.  (What all these commands have in
common is that each line of input produces a line of output.)  In
other contexts, @group can cause anomalous vertical
spacing.

This formatting requirement means that you should write:

@example
@group
...
@end group
@end example

with the @group and @end group commands inside the
@example and @end example commands.

The @group command is most often used to hold an example
together on one page.  In this Texinfo manual, more than 100 examples
contain text that is enclosed between @group and @end
group.

If you forget to end a group, you may get strange and unfathomable
error messages when you run TeX.  This is because TeX keeps
trying to put the rest of the Texinfo file onto the one page and does
not start to generate error messages until it has processed
considerable text.  It is a good rule of thumb to look for a missing
@end group if you get incomprehensible error messages in
TeX.
