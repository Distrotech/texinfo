5 Chapter Structuring
*********************

The chapter structuring commands divide a document into a hierarchy of
chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.  These commands
generate large headings; they also provide information for the table
of contents of a printed manual (see Generating a Table of Contents).

The chapter structuring commands do not create an Info node structure,
so normally you should put an @node command immediately before
each chapter structuring command (see Nodes).  The only time you
are likely to use the chapter structuring commands without using the
node structuring commands is if you are writing a document that
contains no cross references and will never be transformed into Info
format.

It is unlikely that you will ever write a Texinfo file that is
intended only as an Info file and not as a printable document.  If you
do, you might still use chapter structuring commands to create a
heading at the top of each node--but you don't need to.
