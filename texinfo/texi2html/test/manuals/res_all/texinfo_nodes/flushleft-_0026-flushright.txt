10.11 @flushleft and @flushright
================================

The @flushleft and @flushright commands line up the
ends of lines on the left and right margins of a page,
but do not fill the text.  The commands are written on lines of their
own, without braces.  The @flushleft and @flushright
commands are ended by @end flushleft and @end
flushright commands on lines of their own.

For example,

@flushleft
This text is
written flushleft.
@end flushleft

produces

This text is
written flushleft.


@flushright produces the type of indentation often used in the
return address of letters.  For example,

@flushright
Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @code{@flushright} command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.
@end flushright

produces

Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @flushright command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.
