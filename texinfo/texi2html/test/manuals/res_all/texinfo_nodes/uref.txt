8.8 @uref{url[, text][, replacement]}
=====================================

@uref produces a reference to a uniform resource locator (url).
It takes one mandatory argument, the url, and two optional arguments
which control the text that is displayed.  In HTML output, @uref
produces a link you can follow.

The second argument, if specified, is the text to display (the default
is the url itself); in Info and DVI output, but not in HTML output, the
url is also output.

The third argument, on the other hand, if specified is also the text to
display, but the url is not output in any format.  This is useful
when the text is already sufficiently referential, as in a man page.  If
the third argument is given, the second argument is ignored.

The simple one argument form, where the url is both the target and the
text of the link:

The official GNU ftp site is @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu}.

produces:
The official GNU ftp site is <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu>.


An example of the two-argument form:
The official @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu, GNU ftp site}
holds programs and texts.

produces:
The official GNU ftp site <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu>
holds programs and texts.

that is, the Info output is this:
The official GNU ftp site (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu)
holds programs and texts.

and the HTML output is this:
The official <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu">GNU ftp site</a>
holds programs and texts.


An example of the three-argument form:
The @uref{/man.cgi/1/ls,,ls(1)} program ...

produces:
The ls(1) </man.cgi/1/ls> program ...

but with HTML:
The <a href="/man.cgi/1/ls">ls(1)</a> program ...

To merely indicate a url without creating a link people can follow, use
@url (see @url).

Some people prefer to display url's in the unambiguous format:

<URL:http://host/path>

You can use this form in the input file if you wish.  We feel it's not
necessary to clutter up the output with the extra `<URL:' and
`>', since any software that tries to detect url's in text already
has to detect them without the `<URL:' to be useful.
