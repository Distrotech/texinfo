3.4.2 @titlefont, @center, and @sp
----------------------------------

You can use the @titlefont, @sp, and @center
commands to create a title page for a printed document.  (This is the
first of the two methods for creating a title page in Texinfo.)

Use the @titlefont command to select a large font suitable for
the title itself.  You can use @titlefont more than once if you
have an especially long title.

For example:

@titlefont{Texinfo}

Use the @center command at the beginning of a line to center
the remaining text on that line.  Thus,

@center @titlefont{Texinfo}

centers the title, which in this example is "Texinfo" printed
in the title font.

Use the @sp command to insert vertical space.  For example:

@sp 2

This inserts two blank lines on the printed page.  (See @sp, for more information about the @sp
command.)

A template for this method looks like this:

@titlepage
@sp 10
@center @titlefont{name-of-manual-when-printed}
@sp 2
@center subtitle-if-any
@sp 2
@center author
...
@end titlepage

The spacing of the example fits an 8.5 by 11 inch manual.
