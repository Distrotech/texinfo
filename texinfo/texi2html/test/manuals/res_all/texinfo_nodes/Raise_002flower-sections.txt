5.12 @raisesections and @lowersections
======================================

The @raisesections and @lowersections commands raise and
lower the hierarchical level of chapters, sections, subsections and the
like.  The @raisesections command changes sections to chapters,
subsections to sections, and so on.  The @lowersections command
changes chapters to sections, sections to subsections, and so on.

An @lowersections command is useful if you wish to include text
that is written as an outer or standalone Texinfo file in another
Texinfo file as an inner, included file.  If you write the command at
the beginning of the file, all your @chapter commands are
formatted as if they were @section commands, all your
@section command are formatted as if they were
@subsection commands, and so on.

@raisesections raises a command one level in the chapter
structuring hierarchy:

  Change           To

@subsection     @section,
@section        @chapter,
@heading        @chapheading,
          etc.

@lowersections lowers a command one level in the chapter
structuring hierarchy:

  Change           To

@chapter        @section,
@subsection     @subsubsection,
@heading        @subheading,
          etc.

An @raisesections or @lowersections command changes only
those structuring commands that follow the command in the Texinfo file.
Write an @raisesections or @lowersections command on a
line of its own.

An @lowersections command cancels an @raisesections
command, and vice versa.  Typically, the commands are used like this:

@lowersections
@include somefile.texi
@raisesections

Without the @raisesections, all the subsequent sections in your
document will be lowered.

Repeated use of the commands continue to raise or lower the hierarchical
level a step at a time.

An attempt to raise above `chapters' reproduces chapter commands; an
attempt to lower below `subsubsections' reproduces subsubsection
commands.
