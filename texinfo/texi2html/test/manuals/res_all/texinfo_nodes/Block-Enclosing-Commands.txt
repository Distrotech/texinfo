10.1 Block Enclosing Commands
=============================

Here are commands for quotations and examples, explained further in the
following sections:

@quotation
Indicate text that is quoted. The text is filled, indented, and
printed in a roman font by default.

@example
Illustrate code, commands, and the like. The text is printed
in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@verbatim
Mark a piece of text that is to be printed verbatim; no character 
substitutions are made and all commands are ignored, until the next
@end verbatim.  The text is printed in a fixed-width font, 
and not indented or filled.  Extra spaces and blank lines are 
significant, and tabs are expanded.

@smallexample
Same as @example, except that in TeX this command typesets
text in a smaller font.

@lisp
Like @example, but specifically for illustrating Lisp code. The
text is printed in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@smalllisp
Is to @lisp as @smallexample is to @example.

@display
Display illustrative text.  The text is indented but not filled, and
no font is selected (so, by default, the font is roman).

@smalldisplay
Is to @display as @smallexample is to @example.

@format
Like @display (the text is not filled and no font is selected),
but the text is not indented.

@smallformat
Is to @format as @smallexample is to @example.

The @exdent command is used within the above constructs to
undo the indentation of a line.

The @flushleft and @flushright commands are used to line
up the left or right margins of unfilled text.

The @noindent command may be used after one of the above
constructs to prevent the following text from being indented as a new
paragraph.

You can use the @cartouche command within one of the above
constructs to highlight the example or quotation by drawing a box with
rounded corners around it.  See Drawing Cartouches Around Examples.
