11.4.1 Multitable Column Widths
-------------------------------

You can define the column widths for a multitable in two ways: as
fractions of the line length; or with a prototype row.  Mixing the two
methods is not supported.  In either case, the widths are defined
entirely on the same line as the @multitable command.

1. To specify column widths as fractions of the line length, write
@columnfractions and the decimal numbers (presumably less than
1) after the @multitable command, as in:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .33

The fractions need not add up exactly to 1.0, as these do
not.  This allows you to produce tables that do not need the full line
length.  You can use a leading zero if you wish.

2. To specify a prototype row, write the longest entry for each column
enclosed in braces after the @multitable command.  For example:

@multitable {some text for column one} {for column two}

The first column will then have the width of the typeset `some text for
column one', and the second column the width of `for column two'.

The prototype entries need not appear in the table itself.

Although we used simple text in this example, the prototype entries can
contain Texinfo commands; markup commands such as @code are
particularly likely to be useful.
