3.6.1 @documentdescription: Summary text
----------------------------------------

When producing HTML output for a document, makeinfo writes a
`<meta>' element in the `<head>' to give some idea of the
content of the document.  By default, this description is the title
of the document, taken from the @settitle command
(see settitle).  To change this, use the @documentdescription
environment, as in:

@documentdescription
descriptive text.
@end documentdescription

This will produce the following output in the `<head>' of the HTML:

<meta name=description content="descriptive text.">

@documentdescription must be specified before the first node of
the document.
