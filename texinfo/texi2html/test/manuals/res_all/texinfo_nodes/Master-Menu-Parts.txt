3.5.2 Parts of a Master Menu
----------------------------

A master menu is a detailed main menu listing all the nodes in a
file.

A master menu is enclosed in @menu and @end menu
commands and does not appear in the printed document.

Generally, a master menu is divided into parts.

* The first part contains the major nodes in the Texinfo file: the nodes
for the chapters, chapter-like sections, and the appendices.

* The second part contains nodes for the indices.

* The third and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other, lower
level nodes, often ordered by chapter.  This way, rather than go
through an intermediary menu, an inquirer can go directly to a
particular node when searching for specific information.  These menu
items are not required; add them if you think they are a
convenience.  If you do use them, put @detailmenu before the
first one, and @end detailmenu after the last; otherwise,
makeinfo will get confused.

Each section in the menu can be introduced by a descriptive line.  So
long as the line does not begin with an asterisk, it will not be
treated as a menu entry.  (See Writing a Menu, for more
information.)

For example, the master menu for this manual looks like the following
(but has many more entries):

@menu
* Copying Conditions::  Your rights.
* Overview::            Texinfo in brief.
...
* Command and Variable Index::
* Concept Index::       

@detailmenu
