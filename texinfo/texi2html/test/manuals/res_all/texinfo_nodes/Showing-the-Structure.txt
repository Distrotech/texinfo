2.3 Showing the Section Structure of a File
===========================================

You can show the section structure of a Texinfo file by using the
C-c C-s command (texinfo-show-structure).  This command
shows the section structure of a Texinfo file by listing the lines
that begin with the @-commands for @chapter,
@section, and the like.  It constructs what amounts
to a table of contents.  These lines are displayed in another buffer
called the `*Occur*' buffer.  In that buffer, you can position
the cursor over one of the lines and use the C-c C-c command
(occur-mode-goto-occurrence), to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

C-c C-s
M-x texinfo-show-structure
Show the @chapter, @section, and such lines of a
Texinfo file.

C-c C-c
M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence
Go to the line in the Texinfo file corresponding to the line under the
cursor in the `*Occur*' buffer.

If you call texinfo-show-structure with a prefix argument by
typing C-u C-c C-s, it will list not only those lines with the
@-commands for @chapter, @section, and the like, but
also the @node lines.  You can use texinfo-show-structure
with a prefix argument to check whether the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of an @node line are correct.

Often, when you are working on a manual, you will be interested only
in the structure of the current chapter.  In this case, you can mark
off the region of the buffer that you are interested in by using the
C-x n n (narrow-to-region) command and
texinfo-show-structure will work on only that region.  To see
the whole buffer again, use C-x n w (widen).
(See Narrowing in The GNU Emacs Manual, for more
information about the narrowing commands.)

In addition to providing the texinfo-show-structure command,
Texinfo mode sets the value of the page delimiter variable to match
the chapter-level @-commands.  This enables you to use the C-x
] (forward-page) and C-x [ (backward-page)
commands to move forward and backward by chapter, and to use the
C-x p (narrow-to-page) command to narrow to a chapter.
See Pages in The GNU Emacs Manual, for more information
about the page commands.
