19.5 From an Emacs Shell
========================

You can give formatting and printing commands from a shell within GNU
Emacs.  To create a shell within Emacs, type M-x shell.  In this
shell, you can format and print the document.  See Format and Print Hardcopy, for details.

You can switch to and from the shell buffer while tex is
running and do other editing.  If you are formatting a long document
on a slow machine, this can be very convenient.

You can also use texi2dvi from an Emacs shell.  For example,
here is how to use texi2dvi to format and print Using and
Porting GNU CC from a shell within Emacs:

texi2dvi gcc.texinfo
lpr -d gcc.dvi

See Texinfo Mode Printing, for more information about formatting
and printing in Texinfo mode.
