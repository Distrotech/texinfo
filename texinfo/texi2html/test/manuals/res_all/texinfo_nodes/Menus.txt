7 Menus
*******

Menus contain pointers to subordinate nodes.(6) In
Info, you use menus to go to such nodes.  Menus have no effect in
printed manuals and do not appear in them.

By convention, a menu is put at the end of a node since a reader who
uses the menu may not see text that follows it.  Furthermore, a node
that has a menu should not contain much text. If you have a lot of text
and a menu, move most of the text into a new subnode--all but a few
lines.  Otherwise, a reader with a terminal that displays only a few
lines may miss the menu and its associated text.  As a practical matter,
you should locate a menu within 20 lines of the beginning of the
node.
