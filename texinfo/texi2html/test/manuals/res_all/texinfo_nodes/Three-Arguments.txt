8.3.3 @xref with Three Arguments
--------------------------------

A third argument replaces the node name in the TeX output.  The third
argument should be the name of the section in the printed output, or
else state the topic discussed by that section.  Often, you will want to
use initial upper case letters so it will be easier to read when the
reference is printed.  Use a third argument when the node name is
unsuitable because of syntax or meaning.

Remember to avoid placing a comma within the title or topic section of
a cross reference, or within any other section.  The formatters divide
cross references into arguments according to the commas; a comma
within a title or other section will divide it into two arguments.  In
a reference, you need to write a title such as "Clouds, Mist, and
Fog" without the commas.

Also, remember to write a comma or period after the closing brace of an
@xref to terminate the cross reference.  In the following
examples, a clause follows a terminating comma.


The template is like this:

@xref{node-name, cross-reference-name, title-or-topic}.

For example,

@xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning, Thunder and Lightning},
for details.

produces

*Note Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.

and

See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.

If a third argument is given and the second one is empty, then the
third argument serves both.  (Note how two commas, side by side, mark
the empty second argument.)

@xref{Electrical Effects, , Thunder and Lightning},
for details.

produces

*Note Thunder and Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.

and

See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.

As a practical matter, it is often best to write cross references with
just the first argument if the node name and the section title are the
same, and with the first and third arguments if the node name and title
are different.

Here are several examples from The GNU Awk User's Guide:

@xref{Sample Program}.
@xref{Glossary}.
@xref{Case-sensitivity, ,Case-sensitivity in Matching}.
@xref{Close Output, , Closing Output Files and Pipes},
