10.10 @exdent: Undoing a Line's Indentation
===========================================

The @exdent command removes any indentation a line might have.
The command is written at the beginning of a line and applies only to
the text that follows the command that is on the same line.  Do not use
braces around the text.  In a printed manual, the text on an
@exdent line is printed in the roman font.

@exdent is usually used within examples.  Thus,

@example
This line follows an @@example command.
@exdent This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @@end example comes on the next line.
@end group

produces

This line follows an @example command.
This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @end example comes on the next line.

In practice, the @exdent command is rarely used.
Usually, you un-indent text by ending the example and
returning the page to its normal width.
