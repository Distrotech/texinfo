9.2.2 @sc{text}: The Small Caps Font
------------------------------------

Use the `@sc' command to set text in the printed and the HTML
output in A SMALL CAPS FONT and set text in the Info file in upper
case letters.  Write the text you want to be in small caps (where
possible) between braces in lower case, like this:

The @sc{acm} and @sc{ieee} are technical societies.

This produces:

The ACM and IEEE are technical societies.

TeX typesets the small caps font in a manner that prevents the
letters from `jumping out at you on the page'.  This makes small caps
text easier to read than text in all upper case--but it's usually
better to use regular mixed case anyway.  The Info formatting commands
set all small caps text in upper case.  In HTML, the text is upper-cased
and a smaller font is used to render it.

If the text between the braces of an @sc command is uppercase,
TeX typesets in FULL-SIZE CAPITALS.  Use full-size capitals
sparingly, if ever, and since it's redundant to mark all-uppercase text
with @sc, makeinfo warns about such usage.

You may also use the small caps font for a jargon word such as
ATO (a NASA word meaning `abort to orbit').

There are subtleties to using the small caps font with a jargon word
such as CDR, a word used in Lisp programming.  In this case, you
should use the small caps font when the word refers to the second and
subsequent elements of a list (the CDR of the list), but you
should use `@code' when the word refers to the Lisp function of
the same spelling.
