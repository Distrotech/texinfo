10.13 @cartouche: Rounded Rectangles Around Examples
====================================================

In a printed manual, the @cartouche command draws a box with
rounded corners around its contents.  You can use this command to
further highlight an example or quotation.  For instance, you could
write a manual in which one type of example is surrounded by a cartouche
for emphasis.

@cartouche affects only the printed manual; it has no effect in
other output files.

For example,

@example
@cartouche
% pwd
/usr/local/share/emacs
@end cartouche
@end example

surrounds the two-line example with a box with rounded corners, in the
printed manual.
