Menus Need Short Nodes
======================

The short text before a menu may look awkward in a printed manual.  To
avoid this, you can write a menu near the beginning of its node and
follow the menu by an @node line, and then an @heading
line located within @ifinfo and @end ifinfo.  This way,
the menu, @node line, and title appear only in the Info file,
not the printed document.

For example, the preceding two paragraphs follow an Info-only menu,
@node line, and heading, and look like this:

@menu
* Menu Location::             Put a menu in a short node.
* Writing a Menu::            What is a menu?
* Menu Parts::                A menu entry has three parts.
* Less Cluttered Menu Entry:: Two part menu entry.
* Menu Example::              Two and three part entries.
* Other Info Files::          How to refer to a different
                                Info file.

examples of this procedure; one is at the beginning of this chapter.
