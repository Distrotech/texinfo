10.2 @quotation
===============

The text of a quotation is processed normally except that:

* the margins are closer to the center of the page, so the whole of the
quotation is indented;

* the first lines of paragraphs are indented no more than other
lines;

* in the printed output, interparagraph spacing is reduced.

This is an example of text written between an @quotation
command and an @end quotation command.  An @quotation
command is most often used to indicate text that is excerpted from
another (real or hypothetical) printed work.

Write an @quotation command as text on a line by itself.  This
line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the quotation
with a line beginning with and containing only @end quotation.
The @end quotation line will likewise disappear from the
output.  Thus, the following,

@quotation
This is
a foo.
@end quotation

produces

This is a foo.
