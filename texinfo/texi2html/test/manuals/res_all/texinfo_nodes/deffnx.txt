15.3 Two or More `First' Lines
==============================

To create two or more `first' or header lines for a definition, follow
the first @deffn line by a line beginning with @deffnx.
The @deffnx command works exactly like @deffn
except that it does not generate extra vertical white space between it
and the preceding line.

For example,

@deffn {Interactive Command} isearch-forward
@deffnx {Interactive Command} isearch-backward
These two search commands are similar except ...
@end deffn

produces

 -- Interactive Command: isearch-forward
 -- Interactive Command: isearch-backward
These two search commands are similar except ...

Each definition command has an `x' form: @defunx,
@defvrx, @deftypefunx, etc.

The `x' forms work just like @itemx; see @itemx.
