8.3 @xref
=========

The @xref command generates a cross reference for the
beginning of a sentence.  The Info formatting commands convert it into
an Info cross reference, which the Info `f' command can use to
bring you directly to another node.  The TeX typesetting commands
convert it into a page reference, or a reference to another book or
manual.
