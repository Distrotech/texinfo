13.9.4 @print{} (-|): Indicating Printed Output
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes an expression will print output during its execution.  You
can indicate the printed output with the @print{} command.

The @print{} command is displayed as `-|' in Info
and similarly, as a horizontal dash butting against a vertical bar, in
the printed output.

In the following example, the printed text is indicated with
`-|', and the value of the expression follows on the
last line.

(progn (print 'foo) (print 'bar))
     -| foo
     -| bar
     => bar

In a Texinfo source file, this example is written as follows:

@lisp
(progn (print 'foo) (print 'bar))
     @print{} foo
     @print{} bar
     @result{} bar
@end lisp
