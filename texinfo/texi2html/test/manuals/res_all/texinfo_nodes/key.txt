9.1.3 @key{key-name}
--------------------

Use the @key command for the conventional name for a key on a
keyboard, as in:

@key{RET}

You can use the @key command within the argument of an
@kbd command when the sequence of characters to be typed
includes one or more keys that are described by name.

For example, to produce C-x <ESC> you would type:

@kbd{C-x @key{ESC}}

Here is a list of the recommended names for keys:

SPC
Space
RET
Return
LFD
Linefeed (however, since most keyboards nowadays do not have a Linefeed key,
it might be better to call this character C-j.
TAB
Tab
BS
Backspace
ESC
Escape
DEL
Delete
SHIFT
Shift
CTRL
Control
META
Meta

There are subtleties to handling words like `meta' or `ctrl' that are
names of modifier keys.  When mentioning a character in which the
modifier key is used, such as Meta-a, use the @kbd command
alone; do not use the @key command; but when you are referring
to the modifier key in isolation, use the @key command.  For
example, write `@kbd{Meta-a}' to produce Meta-a and
`@key{META}' to produce <META>.
