7.4 A Menu Example
==================

A menu looks like this in Texinfo:

@menu
* menu entry name: Node name.   A short description.
* Node name::                   This form is preferred.
@end menu

This produces:

* menu:

* menu entry name: Node name.   A short description.
* Node name::                   This form is preferred.

Here is an example as you might see it in a Texinfo file:

@menu
Larger Units of Text

* Files::                       All about handling files.
* Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                  several files at once.
@end menu

This produces:

* menu:
Larger Units of Text

* Files::                       All about handling files.
* Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                  several files at once.

In this example, the menu has two entries.  `Files' is both a menu
entry name and the name of the node referred to by that name.
`Multiples' is the menu entry name; it refers to the node named
`Buffers'. The line `Larger Units of Text' is a comment; it
appears in the menu, but is not an entry.

Since no file name is specified with either `Files' or
`Buffers', they must be the names of nodes in the same Info file
(see Referring to Other Info Files).
