6.3.3 @node Line Tips
---------------------

Here are three suggestions:

* Try to pick node names that are informative but short.

In the Info file, the file name, node name, and pointer names are all
inserted on one line, which may run into the right edge of the window.
(This does not cause a problem with Info, but is ugly.)

* Try to pick node names that differ from each other near the beginnings
of their names.  This way, it is easy to use automatic name completion in
Info.

* By convention, node names are capitalized just as they would be for
section or chapter titles--initial and significant words are
capitalized; others are not.
