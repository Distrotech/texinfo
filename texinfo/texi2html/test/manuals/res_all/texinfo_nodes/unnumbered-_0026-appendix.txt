5.5 @unnumbered and @appendix
=============================

Use the @unnumbered command to create a chapter that appears
in a printed manual without chapter numbers of any kind.  Use the
@appendix command to create an appendix in a printed manual
that is labelled by letter instead of by number.

For Info file output, the @unnumbered and @appendix
commands are equivalent to @chapter: the title is printed on a
line by itself with a line of asterisks underneath.  (See @chapter.)

To create an appendix or an unnumbered chapter, write an
@appendix or @unnumbered command at the beginning of a
line and follow it on the same line by the title, as you would if you
were creating a chapter.
