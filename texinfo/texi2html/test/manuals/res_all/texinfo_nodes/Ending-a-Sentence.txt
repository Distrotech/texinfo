13.2.2 Ending a Sentence
------------------------


Use @. instead of a period, @! instead of an
exclamation point, and @? instead of a question mark at the end
of a sentence that ends with a single capital letter.  Otherwise, TeX
will think the letter is an abbreviation and will not insert the correct
end-of-sentence spacing.  Here is an example:

Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W@.  Also, give it to R.J.C@.
Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W.  Also, give it to R.J.C.

produces

Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W.  Also, give it to R.J.C.

Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W.  Also, give it to R.J.C.

In the Info file output, @. is equivalent to a simple
`.'; likewise for @! and @?.

The meanings of @: and @. in Texinfo are designed to
work well with the Emacs sentence motion commands (see (emacs)Sentences section `Sentences' in The GNU Emacs Manual).

Do not put braces after any of these commands.
