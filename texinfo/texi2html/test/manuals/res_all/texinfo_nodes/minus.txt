13.7 @minus{} (-): Inserting a Minus Sign
=========================================

Use the @minus{} command to generate a minus sign.  In a
fixed-width font, this is a single hyphen, but in a proportional font,
the symbol is the customary length for a minus sign--a little longer
than a hyphen, shorter than an em-dash:

`-' is a minus sign generated with `@minus{}',

`-' is a hyphen generated with the character `-',

`--' is an em-dash for text.

In the fixed-width font used by Info, @minus{} is the same
as a hyphen.

You should not use @minus{} inside @code or
@example because the width distinction is not made in the
fixed-width font they use.

When you use @minus to specify the mark beginning each entry in
an itemized list, you do not need to type the braces
(see @itemize.)
