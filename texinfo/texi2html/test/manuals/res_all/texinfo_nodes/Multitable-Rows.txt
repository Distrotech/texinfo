11.4.2 Multitable Rows
----------------------

After the @multitable command defining the column widths (see
the previous section), you begin each row in the body of a multitable
with @item, and separate the column entries with @tab.
Line breaks are not special within the table body, and you may break
input lines in your source file as necessary.

Here is a complete example of a multi-column table (the text is from
The GNU Emacs Manual, see (emacs)Split Window section `Splitting Windows' in The GNU Emacs Manual):

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .45 .4
@item Key @tab Command @tab Description
@item C-x 2
@tab @code{split-window-vertically}
@tab Split the selected window into two windows,
with one above the other.
@item C-x 3
@tab @code{split-window-horizontally}
@tab Split the selected window into two windows
positioned side by side.
@item C-Mouse-2
@tab
@tab In the mode line or scroll bar of a window,
split that window.
@end multitable

produces:
