18 Defining New Texinfo Commands
********************************

Texinfo provides several ways to define new commands:

* A Texinfo macro allows you to define a new Texinfo command as any
sequence of text and/or existing commands (including other macros).  The
macro can have any number of parameters--text you supply each
time you use the macro.

Incidentally, these macros have nothing to do with the @defmac
command, which is for documenting macros in the subject of the manual
(see Def Cmd Template).

* `@alias' is a convenient way to define a new name for an existing
command.

* `@definfoenclose' allows you to define new commands with
customized output in the Info file.


* Defining Macros::             Defining and undefining new commands.
* Invoking Macros::             Using a macro, once you've defined it.
* Macro Details::               Beyond basic macro usage.
* alias::                       Command aliases.
* definfoenclose::              Customized highlighting.
