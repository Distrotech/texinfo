14.1 @*: Generate Line Breaks
=============================

The @* command forces a line break in both the printed manual and
in Info.

For example,

This line @* is broken @*in two places.

produces

This line
 is broken
in two places.

(Note that the space after the first @* command is faithfully
carried down to the next line.)

The @* command is often used in a file's copyright page:

This is edition 2.0 of the Texinfo documentation,@*
and is for ...

In this case, the @* command keeps TeX from stretching the
line across the whole page in an ugly manner.

Please note: Do not write braces after an @* command;
they are not needed.

Do not write an @refill command at the end of a paragraph
containing an @* command; it will cause the paragraph to be
refilled after the line break occurs, negating the effect of the line
break.
