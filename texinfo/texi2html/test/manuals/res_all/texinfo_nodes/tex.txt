13.5.1 @TeX{} (TeX)
-------------------

Use the @TeX{} command to generate `TeX'.  In a printed
manual, this is a special logo that is different from three ordinary
letters.  In Info, it just looks like `TeX'.  The
@TeX{} command is unique among Texinfo commands in that the
`T' and the `X' are in upper case.
