D.4 Sample File with @include
=============================

Here is an example of a complete outer Texinfo file with @include files
within it before running texinfo-multiple-files-update, which
would insert a main or master menu:

\input texinfo @c -*-texinfo-*-
@setfilename  include-example.info
@settitle Include Example

@setchapternewpage odd
@titlepage
@sp 12
@center @titlefont{Include Example}
@sp 2
@center by Whom Ever

@page
@vskip 0pt plus 1filll

@end titlepage

@ifinfo
@node Top, First, , (dir)
@top Master Menu
@end ifinfo

@include foo.texinfo
@include bar.texinfo
@include concept-index.texinfo

@summarycontents
@contents

@bye

An included file, such as `foo.texinfo', might look like this:

@node First, Second, , Top
@chapter First Chapter

Contents of first chapter ...

The full contents of `concept-index.texinfo' might be as simple as this:

@node Concept Index
@unnumbered Concept Index

@printindex cp

The outer Texinfo source file for The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual is named `elisp.texi'.  This outer file contains a master
menu with 417 entries and a list of 41 @include
files.
