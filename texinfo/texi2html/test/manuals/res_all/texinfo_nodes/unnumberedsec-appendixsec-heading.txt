5.8 @unnumberedsec, @appendixsec, @heading
==========================================

The @unnumberedsec, @appendixsec, and @heading
commands are, respectively, the unnumbered, appendix-like, and
heading-like equivalents of the @section command.
(See @section.)

@unnumberedsec
The @unnumberedsec command may be used within an
unnumbered chapter or within a regular chapter or appendix to
provide an unnumbered section.

@appendixsec
@appendixsection
@appendixsection is a longer spelling of the
@appendixsec command; the two are synonymous.

Conventionally, the @appendixsec or @appendixsection
command is used only within appendices.

@heading
You may use the @heading command anywhere you wish for a
section-style heading that will not appear in the table of contents.
