13.9.6 @equiv{} (==): Indicating Equivalence
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes two expressions produce identical results.  You can indicate the
exact equivalence of two forms with the @equiv{} command.

The @equiv{} command is displayed as `==' in Info
and as a three parallel horizontal lines in the printed output.

Thus,

@lisp
(make-sparse-keymap) @equiv{} (list 'keymap)
@end lisp

produces

(make-sparse-keymap) == (list 'keymap)

This indicates that evaluating (make-sparse-keymap) produces
identical results to evaluating (list 'keymap).
