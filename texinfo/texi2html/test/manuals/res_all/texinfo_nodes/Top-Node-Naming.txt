8.4 Naming a `Top' Node
=======================

In a cross reference, you must always name a node.  This means that in
order to refer to a whole manual, you must identify the `Top' node by
writing it as the first argument to the @xref command.  (This
is different from the way you write a menu entry; see Referring to Other Info Files.)  At the same time, to
provide a meaningful section topic or title in the printed cross
reference (instead of the word `Top'), you must write an appropriate
entry for the third argument to the @xref command.


Thus, to make a cross reference to The GNU Make Manual,
write:

@xref{Top, , Overview, make, The GNU Make Manual}.

which produces

*Note Overview: (make)Top.

and

See section "Overview" in The GNU Make Manual.

In this example, `Top' is the name of the first node, and
`Overview' is the name of the first section of the manual.
