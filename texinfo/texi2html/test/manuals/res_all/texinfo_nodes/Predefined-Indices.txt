12.2 Predefined Indices
=======================

Texinfo provides six predefined indices:

* A concept index listing concepts that are discussed.

* A function index listing functions (such as entry points of
libraries).

* A variables index listing variables (such as global variables
of libraries).

* A keystroke index listing keyboard commands.

* A program index listing names of programs.

* A data type index listing data types (such as structures defined in
header files).

Not every manual needs all of these, and most manuals use two or three
of them.  This manual has two indices: a
concept index and an @-command index (that is actually the function
index but is called a command index in the chapter heading).  Two or
more indices can be combined into one using the @synindex or
@syncodeindex commands.  See Combining Indices.
