E.3 How to Make Your Own Headings
=================================

You can use the standard headings provided with Texinfo or specify
your own.  By default, Texinfo has no footers, so if you specify them,
the available page size for the main text will be slightly reduced.

Texinfo provides six commands for specifying headings and
footings:
* @everyheading @everyfooting generate page headers and
footers that are the same for both even- and odd-numbered pages.
* @evenheading and @evenfooting command generate headers
and footers for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.
* @oddheading and @oddfooting generate headers and footers
for odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.

Write custom heading specifications in the Texinfo file immediately
after the @end titlepage command.
You must cancel the predefined heading commands with the
@headings off command before defining your own
specifications.

Here is how to tell TeX to place the chapter name at the left, the
page number in the center, and the date at the right of every header
for both even- and odd-numbered pages:

@headings off
@everyheading @thischapter @| @thispage @| @today{}

You need to divide the left part from the central part and the central
part from the right part by inserting `@|' between parts.
Otherwise, the specification command will not be able to tell where
the text for one part ends and the next part begins.

Each part can contain text or @-commands.  The text
is printed as if the part were within an ordinary paragraph in the
body of the page.  The @-commands replace
themselves with the page number, date, chapter name, or
whatever.

Here are the six heading and footing commands:

@everyheading left @| center @| right
@everyfooting left @| center @| right

The `every' commands specify the format for both even- and odd-numbered
pages.  These commands are for documents that are printed on one side
of each sheet of paper, or for documents in which you want symmetrical
headers or footers.

@evenheading left @| center @| right
@oddheading  left @| center @| right
@evenfooting left @| center @| right
@oddfooting  left @| center @| right

The `even' and `odd' commands specify the format for even-numbered
pages and odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for books and
manuals that are printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.

Use the `@this...' series of @-commands to
provide the names of chapters
and sections and the page number.  You can use the
`@this...' commands in the left, center, or right portions
of headers and footers, or anywhere else in a Texinfo file so long as
they are between @iftex and @end iftex commands.

Here are the `@this...' commands:

@thispage
Expands to the current page number.

@thischaptername
Expands to the name of the current chapter.

@thischapter
Expands to the number and name of the current
chapter, in the format `Chapter 1: Title'.

@thistitle
Expands to the name of the document, as specified by the
@settitle command.

@thisfile
For @include files only: expands to the name of the current
@include file.  If the current Texinfo source file is not an
@include file, this command has no effect.  This command does
not provide the name of the current Texinfo source file unless
it is an @include file.  (See Include Files, for more
information about @include files.)

You can also use the @today{} command, which expands to the
current date, in `1 Jan 1900' format.

Other @-commands and text are printed in a header or footer just as
if they were in the body of a page.  It is useful to incorporate text,
particularly when you are writing drafts:

@headings off
@everyheading @emph{Draft!} @| @thispage @| @thischapter
@everyfooting @| @| Version: 0.27: @today{}

Beware of overlong titles: they may overlap another part of the
header or footer and blot it out.
