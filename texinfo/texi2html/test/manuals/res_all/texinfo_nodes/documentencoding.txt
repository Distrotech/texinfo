17.2 @documentencoding enc: Set Input Encoding
==============================================


The @documentencoding command declares the input document
encoding.  Write it on a line by itself, with a valid encoding
specification following, such as `ISO-8859-1'.

At present, this is used only in HTML output from makeinfo.  If a
document encoding enc is specified, it is used in a
`<meta>' tag included in the `<head>' of the output:

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
      charset=enc">
