3.7 Software Copying Permissions
================================

If the Texinfo file has a section containing the "General Public
License" and the distribution information and a warranty disclaimer for
the software that is documented, we recommend placing this right after
the `Top' node.  The General Public License is very important to Project
GNU software.  It ensures that you and others will continue to have a
right to use and share the software.

The copying and distribution information and the disclaimer are followed
by an introduction or else by the first chapter of the manual.

Although an introduction is not a required part of a Texinfo file, it
is very helpful.  Ideally, it should state clearly and concisely what
the file is about and who would be interested in reading it.  In
general, an introduction would follow the licensing and distribution
information, although sometimes people put it earlier in the document.
