3.4.6 The @headings Command
---------------------------

The @headings command is rarely used.  It specifies what kind of
page headings and footings to print on each page.  Usually, this is
controlled by the @setchapternewpage command.  You need the
@headings command only if the @setchapternewpage command
does not do what you want, or if you want to turn off pre-defined page
headings prior to defining your own.  Write an @headings command
immediately after the @end titlepage command.

You can use @headings as follows:

@headings off
Turn off printing of page headings.

@headings single
Turn on page headings appropriate for single-sided printing.


@headings double
@headings on
Turn on page headings appropriate for double-sided printing.  The two
commands, @headings on and @headings double, are
synonymous.

@headings singleafter
@headings doubleafter
Turn on single or double headings, respectively, after the
current page is output.

@headings on
Turn on page headings: single if `@setchapternewpage
on', double otherwise.

For example, suppose you write @setchapternewpage off before the
@titlepage command to tell TeX to start a new chapter on the
same page as the end of the last chapter.  This command also causes
TeX to typeset page headers for single-sided printing.  To cause
TeX to typeset for double sided printing, write @headings
double after the @end titlepage command.

You can stop TeX from generating any page headings at all by
writing @headings off on a line of its own immediately after the
line containing the @end titlepage command, like this:

@end titlepage
@headings off

The @headings off command overrides the @end titlepage
command, which would otherwise cause TeX to print page
headings.

You can also specify your own style of page heading and footing.
See Page Headings, for more information.
