10.8 @display and @smalldisplay
===============================

The @display command begins a kind of example.  It is like the
@example command
except that, in
a printed manual, @display does not select the fixed-width
font.  In fact, it does not specify the font at all, so that the text
appears in the same font it would have appeared in without the
@display command.

This is an example of text written between an @display command
and an @end display command.  The @display command
indents the text, but does not fill it.

Texinfo also provides a command @smalldisplay, which is like
@display but uses a smaller font in @smallbook format.
See small.
