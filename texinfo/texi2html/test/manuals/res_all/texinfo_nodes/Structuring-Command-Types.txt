5.2 Structuring Command Types
=============================

The chapter structuring commands fall into four groups or series, each
of which contains structuring commands corresponding to the
hierarchical levels of chapters, sections, subsections, and
subsubsections.

The four groups are the @chapter series, the
@unnumbered series, the @appendix series, and the
@heading series.

Each command produces titles that have a different appearance on the
printed page or Info file; only some of the commands produce
titles that are listed in the table of contents of a printed book or
manual.

* The @chapter and @appendix series of commands produce
numbered or lettered entries both in the body of a printed work and in
its table of contents.

* The @unnumbered series of commands produce unnumbered entries
both in the body of a printed work and in its table of contents.  The
@top command, which has a special use, is a member of this
series (see @top).

* The @heading series of commands produce unnumbered headings
that do not appear in a table of contents.  The heading commands never
start a new page.

* The @majorheading command produces results similar to using
the @chapheading command but generates a larger vertical
whitespace before the heading.

* When an @setchapternewpage command says to do so, the
@chapter, @unnumbered, and @appendix commands
start new pages in the printed manual; the @heading commands
do not.

Here are the four groups of chapter structuring commands:


    No new page
 Numbered Unnumbered Lettered/numbered Unnumbered
 In contents In contents In contents Omitted from
contents
  @top  @majorheading
 @chapter @unnumbered @appendix @chapheading
 @section @unnumberedsec @appendixsec @heading
 @subsection @unnumberedsubsec @appendixsubsec @subheading
 @subsubsection @unnumberedsubsubsec @appendixsubsubsec @subsubheading
