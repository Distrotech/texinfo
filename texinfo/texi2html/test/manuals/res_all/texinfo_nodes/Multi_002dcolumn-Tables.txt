11.4 Multi-column Tables
========================

@multitable allows you to construct tables with any number of
columns, with each column having any width you like.

You define the column widths on the @multitable line itself, and
write each row of the actual table following an @item command,
with columns separated by an @tab command.  Finally, @end
multitable completes the table.  Details in the sections below.

* Multitable Column Widths::    Defining multitable column widths.
* Multitable Rows::             Defining multitable rows, with examples.
