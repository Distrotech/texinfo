13.1 Inserting @ and Braces
===========================

`@' and curly braces are special characters in Texinfo.  To insert
these characters so they appear in text, you must put an `@' in
front of these characters to prevent Texinfo from misinterpreting
them.

Do not put braces after any of these commands; they are not
necessary.
