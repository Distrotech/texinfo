19.3 Format with texi2dvi
=========================

The texi2dvi command automatically runs both tex and
texindex as many times as necessary to produce a DVI file with
sorted indices and all cross-references resolved.  It simplifies the
tex--texindex--tex--tex sequence
described in the previous section.

To run texi2dvi on an input file `foo.texi', do this (where
`prompt$ ' is your shell prompt):

prompt$ texi2dvi foo.texi

As shown in this example, the input filenames to texi2dvi must
include any extension (`.texi', `.texinfo', etc.).  Under
MS-DOS and perhaps in other circumstances, you may need to run `sh
texi2dvi foo.texi' instead of relying on the operating system to invoke
the shell on the `texi2dvi' script.

Perhaps the most useful option to texi2dvi is
`--texinfo=cmd'.  This inserts cmd on a line by itself
after the @setfilename in a temporary copy of the input file
before running TeX.  With this, you can specify different printing
formats, such as @smallbook (see smallbook),
@afourpaper (see A4 Paper), or @pagesizes
(see pagesizes), without actually changing the document source.
(You can also do this on a site-wide basis with `texinfo.cnf';
see Preparing for TeX).

For a list of other options, run `texi2dvi --help'.
