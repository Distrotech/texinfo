20.2.4 Installing Info Directory Files
--------------------------------------

When you install an Info file onto your system, you can use the program
install-info to update the Info directory file `dir'.
Normally the makefile for the package runs install-info, just
after copying the Info file into its proper installed location.

In order for the Info file to work with install-info, you include
the commands @dircategory and
@direntry...@end direntry in the Texinfo source
file.  Use @direntry to specify the menu entries to add to the
Info directory file, and use @dircategory to specify which part
of the Info directory to put it in.  Here is how these commands are used
in this manual:

@dircategory Texinfo documentation system
@direntry
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. ...
...
@end direntry

Here's what this produces in the Info file:

INFO-DIR-SECTION Texinfo documentation system
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. ...
...
END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY

The install-info program sees these lines in the Info file, and
that is how it knows what to do.

Always use the @direntry and @dircategory commands near
the beginning of the Texinfo input, before the first @node
command.  If you use them later on in the input, install-info
will not notice them.

If you use @dircategory more than once in the Texinfo source,
each usage specifies the `current' category; any subsequent
@direntry commands will add to that category.  

Here are some recommended @dircategory categories:

GNU packages
GNU programming tools
GNU programming documentation
GNU Emacs Lisp
GNU libraries
TeX
Individual utilities

The idea is to include the `Invoking' node for every program installed
by a package under `Individual utilities', and an entry for the manual
as a whole in the appropriate other category.
