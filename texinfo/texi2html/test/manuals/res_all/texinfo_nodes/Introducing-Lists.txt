Introducing Lists

Introducing Lists
=================

Texinfo automatically indents the text in lists or tables, and numbers
an enumerated list.  This last feature is useful if you modify the
list, since you do not need to renumber it yourself.

Numbered lists and tables begin with the appropriate @-command at the
beginning of a line, and end with the corresponding @end
command on a line by itself.  The table and itemized-list commands
also require that you write formatting information on the same line as
the beginning @-command.

Begin an enumerated list, for example, with an @enumerate
command and end the list with an @end enumerate command.
Begin an itemized list with an @itemize command, followed on
the same line by a formatting command such as @bullet, and end
the list with an @end itemize command.

Precede each element of a list with an @item or @itemx
command.


Here is an itemized list of the different kinds of table and lists:

* Itemized lists with and without bullets.

* Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

* Two-column tables with highlighting.


Here is an enumerated list with the same items:

1. Itemized lists with and without bullets.

2. Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

3. Two-column tables with highlighting.


And here is a two-column table with the same items and their
@-commands:

@itemize
Itemized lists with and without bullets.

@enumerate
Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

@table
@ftable
@vtable
Two-column tables, optionally with indexing.
