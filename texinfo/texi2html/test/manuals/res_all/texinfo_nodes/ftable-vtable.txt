11.3.1 @ftable and @vtable
--------------------------

The @ftable and @vtable commands are the same as the
@table command except that @ftable automatically enters
each of the items in the first column of the table into the index of
functions and @vtable automatically enters each of the items in
the first column of the table into the index of variables.  This
simplifies the task of creating indices.  Only the items on the same
line as the @item commands are indexed, and they are indexed in
exactly the form that they appear on that line.  See Indices,
for more information about indices.

Begin a two-column table using @ftable or @vtable by
writing the @-command at the beginning of a line, followed on the same
line by an argument that is a Texinfo command such as @code,
exactly as you would for an @table command; and end the table
with an @end ftable or @end vtable command on a line by
itself.

See the example for @table in the previous section.
