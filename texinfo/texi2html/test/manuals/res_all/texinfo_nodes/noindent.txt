10.12 @noindent: Omitting Indentation
=====================================

An example or other inclusion can break a paragraph into segments.
Ordinarily, the formatters indent text that follows an example as a new
paragraph.  However, you can prevent this by writing @noindent
at the beginning of a line by itself preceding the continuation
text.

For example:

@example
This is an example
@end example

@noindent
This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@code{@@display} and @code{@@end display}.)

produces

This is an example

This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@display and @end display.)

To adjust the number of blank lines properly in the Info file output,
remember that the line containing @noindent does not generate a
blank line, and neither does the @end example line.

In the Texinfo source file for this manual, each line that says
`produces' is preceded by a line containing @noindent.

Do not put braces after an @noindent command; they are not
necessary, since @noindent is a command used outside of
paragraphs (see Command Syntax).
