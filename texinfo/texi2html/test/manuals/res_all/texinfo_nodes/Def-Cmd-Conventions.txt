15.5 Conventions for Writing Definitions
========================================

When you write a definition using @deffn, @defun, or
one of the other definition commands, please take care to use
arguments that indicate the meaning, as with the count argument
to the forward-word function.  Also, if the name of an argument
contains the name of a type, such as integer, take care that the
argument actually is of that type.
