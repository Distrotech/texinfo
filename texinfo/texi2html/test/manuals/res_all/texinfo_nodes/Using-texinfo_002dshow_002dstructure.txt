F.3 Using texinfo-show-structure
================================

It is not always easy to keep track of the nodes, chapters, sections, and
subsections of a Texinfo file.  This is especially true if you are revising
or adding to a Texinfo file that someone else has written.

In GNU Emacs, in Texinfo mode, the texinfo-show-structure
command lists all the lines that begin with the @-commands that
specify the structure: @chapter, @section,
@appendix, and so on.  With an argument (C-u
as prefix argument, if interactive),
the command also shows the @node lines.  The
texinfo-show-structure command is bound to C-c C-s in
Texinfo mode, by default.

The lines are displayed in a buffer called the `*Occur*' buffer,
indented by hierarchical level.  For example, here is a part of what was
produced by running texinfo-show-structure on this manual:

 Lines matching "^@\\(chapter \\|sect\\|subs\\|subh\\|
 unnum\\|major\\|chapheading \\|heading \\|appendix\\)"
 in buffer texinfo.texi.
 ...
 4177:@chapter Nodes
 4198:    @heading Two Paths
 4231:    @section Node and Menu Illustration
 4337:    @section The @code{@@node} Command
 4393:        @subheading Choosing Node and Pointer Names
 4417:        @subsection How to Write an @code{@@node} Line
 4469:        @subsection @code{@@node} Line Tips
 ...

This says that lines 4337, 4393, and 4417 of `texinfo.texi' begin
with the @section, @subheading, and @subsection
commands respectively.  If you move your cursor into the `*Occur*'
window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and use the
C-c C-c command (occur-mode-goto-occurrence), to jump to
the corresponding spot in the Texinfo file.  See (emacs)Other Repeating Search section `Using Occur' in The GNU Emacs Manual, for more
information about occur-mode-goto-occurrence.

The first line in the `*Occur*' window describes the regular
expression specified by texinfo-heading-pattern.  This regular
expression is the pattern that texinfo-show-structure looks for.
See (emacs)Regexps section `Using Regular Expressions' in The GNU Emacs Manual,
for more information.

When you invoke the texinfo-show-structure command, Emacs will
display the structure of the whole buffer.  If you want to see the
structure of just a part of the buffer, of one chapter, for example,
use the C-x n n (narrow-to-region) command to mark the
region.  (See (emacs)Narrowing section `Narrowing' in The GNU Emacs Manual.)  This is
how the example used above was generated.  (To see the whole buffer
again, use C-x n w (widen).)

If you call texinfo-show-structure with a prefix argument by
typing C-u C-c C-s, it will list lines beginning with
@node as well as the lines beginning with the @-sign commands
for @chapter, @section, and the like.

You can remind yourself of the structure of a Texinfo file by looking at
the list in the `*Occur*' window; and if you have mis-named a node
or left out a section, you can correct the mistake.
