19.11 Printing "Small" Books
============================

By default, TeX typesets pages for printing in an 8.5 by 11 inch
format.  However, you can direct TeX to typeset a document in a 7 by
9.25 inch format that is suitable for bound books by inserting the
following command on a line by itself at the beginning of the Texinfo
file, before the title page:

@smallbook

(Since many books are about 7 by 9.25 inches, this command might better
have been called the @regularbooksize command, but it came to be
called the @smallbook command by comparison to the 8.5 by 11 inch format.)

If you write the @smallbook command between the
start-of-header and end-of-header lines, the Texinfo mode TeX
region formatting command, texinfo-tex-region, will format the
region in "small" book size (see Start of Header).

See small, for information about
commands that make it easier to produce examples for a smaller manual.

See Format with texi2dvi, and Preparing for TeX, for other ways to format with @smallbook that do not
require changing the source file.
