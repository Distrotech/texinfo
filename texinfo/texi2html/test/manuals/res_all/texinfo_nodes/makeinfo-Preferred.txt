makeinfo Find Errors
====================

The makeinfo program does an excellent job of catching errors
and reporting them--far better than texinfo-format-region or
texinfo-format-buffer.  In addition, the various functions for
automatically creating and updating node pointers and menus remove
many opportunities for human error.

If you can, use the updating commands to create and insert pointers
and menus.  These prevent many errors.  Then use makeinfo (or
its Texinfo mode manifestations, makeinfo-region and
makeinfo-buffer) to format your file and check for other
errors.  This is the best way to work with Texinfo.  But if you
cannot use makeinfo, or your problem is very puzzling, then you
may want to use the tools described in this appendix.
