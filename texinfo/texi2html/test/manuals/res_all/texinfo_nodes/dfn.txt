9.1.11 @dfn{term}
-----------------

Use the @dfn command to identify the introductory or defining
use of a technical term.  Use the command only in passages whose
purpose is to introduce a term which will be used again or which the
reader ought to know.  Mere passing mention of a term for the first
time does not deserve @dfn.  The command generates italics in
the printed manual, and double quotation marks in the Info file.  For
example:

Getting rid of a file is called @dfn{deleting} it.

produces

Getting rid of a file is called deleting it.

As a general rule, a sentence containing the defining occurrence of a
term should be a definition of the term.  The sentence does not need
to say explicitly that it is a definition, but it should contain the
information of a definition--it should make the meaning clear.
