Texinfo Mode Overview
=====================

Texinfo mode provides special features for working with Texinfo
files.
You can:

* Insert frequently used @-commands. 

* Automatically create @node lines.

* Show the structure of a Texinfo source file.

* Automatically create or update the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers of a node.

* Automatically create or update menus.

* Automatically create a master menu.

* Format a part or all of a file for Info.

* Typeset and print part or all of a file.

Perhaps the two most helpful features are those for inserting frequently
used @-commands and for creating node pointers and menus.
