5.1 Tree Structure of Sections
==============================

A Texinfo file is usually structured like a book with chapters,
sections, subsections, and the like.  This structure can be visualized
as a tree (or rather as an upside-down tree) with the root at the top
and the levels corresponding to chapters, sections, subsection, and
subsubsections.

Here is a diagram that shows a Texinfo file with three chapters,
each of which has two sections.

                          Top
                           |
         -------------------------------------
        |                  |                  |
     Chapter 1          Chapter 2          Chapter 3
        |                  |                  |
     --------           --------           --------
    |        |         |        |         |        |
 Section  Section   Section  Section   Section  Section
   1.1      1.2       2.1      2.2       3.1      3.2


In a Texinfo file that has this structure, the beginning of Chapter 2
looks like this:

@node    Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, top
@chapter Chapter 2

The chapter structuring commands are described in the sections that
follow; the @node and @menu commands are described in
following chapters. (See Nodes, and see Menus.)
