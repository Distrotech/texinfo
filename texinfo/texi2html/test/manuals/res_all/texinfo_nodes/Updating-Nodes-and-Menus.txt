2.4 Updating Nodes and Menus
============================

Texinfo mode provides commands for automatically creating or updating
menus and node pointers.  The commands are called "update" commands
because their most frequent use is for updating a Texinfo file after you
have worked on it; but you can use them to insert the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers into an @node line that has none
and to create menus in a file that has none.

If you do not use the updating commands, you need to write menus and
node pointers by hand, which is a tedious task.
