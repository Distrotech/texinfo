8.7 @inforef
============

@inforef is used for cross references to Info files for which
there are no printed manuals.  Even in a printed manual,
@inforef generates a reference directing the user to look in
an Info file.

The command takes either two or three arguments, in the following
order:

1. The node name.

2. The cross reference name (optional).

3. The Info file name.

Separate the arguments with commas, as with @xref.  Also, you
must terminate the reference with a comma or period after the
`}', as you do with @xref.

The template is:

@inforef{node-name, cross-reference-name, info-file-name},

Thus,

@inforef{Expert, Advanced Info commands, info},
for more information.

produces

*Note Advanced Info commands: (info)Expert,
for more information.

and

See Info file `info', node `Expert', for more information.

Similarly,

@inforef{Expert, , info}, for more information.

produces

*Note (info)Expert::, for more information.

and

See Info file `info', node `Expert', for more information.

The converse of @inforef is @cite, which is used to
refer to printed works for which no Info form exists.  See @cite.
