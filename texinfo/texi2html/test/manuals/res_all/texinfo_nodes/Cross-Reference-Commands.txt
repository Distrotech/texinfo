8.1 Different Cross Reference Commands
======================================

There are four different cross reference commands:

@xref
Used to start a sentence in the printed manual saying `See ...'
or an Info cross-reference saying `*Note name: node.'.

@ref
Used within or, more often, at the end of a sentence; same as
@xref for Info; produces just the reference in the printed
manual without a preceding `See'.

@pxref
Used within parentheses to make a reference that suits both an Info
file and a printed book.  Starts with a lower case `see' within the
printed manual. (`p' is for `parenthesis'.)

@inforef
Used to make a reference to an Info file for which there is no printed
manual.

(The @cite command is used to make references to books and
manuals for which there is no corresponding Info file and, therefore,
no node to which to point.   See @cite.)
