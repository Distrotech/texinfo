F.5 Finding Badly Referenced Nodes
==================================

You can use the Info-validate command to check whether any of
the `Next', `Previous', `Up' or other node pointers fail to point to a
node.  This command checks that every node pointer points to an
existing node.  The Info-validate command works only on Info
files, not on Texinfo files.

The makeinfo program validates pointers automatically, so you
do not need to use the Info-validate command if you are using
makeinfo.  You only may need to use Info-validate if you
are unable to run makeinfo and instead must create an Info file
using texinfo-format-region or texinfo-format-buffer, or
if you write an Info file from scratch.
