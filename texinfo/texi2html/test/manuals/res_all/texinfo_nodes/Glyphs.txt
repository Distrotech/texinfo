13.9 Glyphs for Examples
========================

In Texinfo, code is often illustrated in examples that are delimited
by @example and @end example, or by @lisp and
@end lisp.  In such examples, you can indicate the results of
evaluation or an expansion using `=>' or
`==>'.  Likewise, there are commands to insert glyphs
to indicate
printed output, error messages, equivalence of expressions, and the
location of point.

The glyph-insertion commands do not need to be used within an example, but
most often they are.  Every  glyph-insertion command is followed by a pair of
left- and right-hand braces.
