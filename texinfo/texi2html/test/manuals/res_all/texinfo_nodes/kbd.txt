9.1.2 @kbd{keyboard-characters}
-------------------------------

Use the @kbd command for characters of input to be typed by
users.  For example, to refer to the characters M-a,
write

@kbd{M-a}

and to refer to the characters M-x shell, write

@kbd{M-x shell}

The @kbd command has the same effect as @code in Info,
but by default produces a different font (slanted typewriter instead of
normal typewriter) in the printed manual, so users can distinguish the
characters they are supposed to type from those the computer outputs.

Since the usage of @kbd varies from manual to manual, you can
control the font switching with the @kbdinputstyle command.
This command has no effect on Info output.  Write this command at the
beginning of a line with a single word as an argument, one of the
following:
`code'
Always use the same font for @kbd as @code.
`example'
Use the distinguishing font for @kbd only in @example
and similar environments.
`distinct'
(the default) Always use the distinguishing font for @kbd.

You can embed another @-command inside the braces of an @kbd
command.  Here, for example, is the way to describe a command that
would be described more verbosely as "press an `r' and then
press the <RET> key":

@kbd{r @key{RET}}

This produces: r <RET>

You also use the @kbd command if you are spelling out the letters
you type; for example:

To give the @code{logout} command,
type the characters @kbd{l o g o u t @key{RET}}.

This produces:

To give the logout command,
type the characters l o g o u t <RET>.

(Also, this example shows that you can add spaces for clarity.  If you
really want to mention a space character as one of the characters of
input, write @key{SPC} for it.)
