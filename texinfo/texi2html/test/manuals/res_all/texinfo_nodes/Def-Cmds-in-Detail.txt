15.4 The Definition Commands
============================

Texinfo provides more than a dozen definition commands, all of which
are described in this section.

The definition commands automatically enter the name of the entity in
the appropriate index: for example, @deffn, @defun,
and @defmac enter function names in the index of functions;
@defvr and @defvar enter variable names in the index
of variables.

Although the examples that follow mostly illustrate Lisp, the commands
can be used for other programming languages.

* Functions Commands::          Commands for functions and similar entities.
* Variables Commands::          Commands for variables and similar entities.
* Typed Functions::             Commands for functions in typed languages.
* Typed Variables::             Commands for variables in typed languages.
* Abstract Objects::            Commands for object-oriented programming.
* Data Types::                  The definition command for data types.
