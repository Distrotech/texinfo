6.5 @anchor: Defining Arbitrary Cross-reference Targets
=======================================================


An anchor is a position in your document, labeled so that
cross-references can refer to it, just as they can to nodes.  You create
an anchor with the @anchor command, and give the label as a
normal brace-delimited argument.  For example:

This marks the @anchor{x-spot}spot.
...
@xref{x-spot,,the spot}.

produces:

This marks the spot.
...
See [the spot], page 1.

As you can see, the @anchor command itself produces no output.
This example defines an anchor `x-spot' just before the word `spot'.
You can refer to it later with an @xref or other cross-reference
command, as shown.  See Cross References, for details on the
cross-reference commands.

It is best to put @anchor commands just before the position you
wish to refer to; that way, the reader's eye is led on to the correct
text when they jump to the anchor.  You can put the @anchor
command on a line by itself if that helps readability of the source.
Spaces are always ignored after @anchor.

Anchor names and node names may not conflict.  Anchors and nodes are
given similar treatment in some ways; for example, the goto-node
command in standalone Info takes either an anchor name or a node name as
an argument.  (See goto-node in GNU Info.)
