16 Conditionally Visible Text
*****************************

Sometimes it is good to use different text for different output formats.
For example, you can use the conditional commands to specify
different text for the printed manual and the Info output.

Conditional commands may not be nested.

The conditional commands comprise the following categories.

* Commands for HTML, Info, or TeX.
* Commands for not HTML, Info, or TeX.
* Raw TeX or HTML commands.
* Substituting text for all formats, and testing if a flag is set or clear.

* Conditional Commands::        Specifying text for HTML, Info, or TeX.
* Conditional Not Commands::    Specifying text for not HTML, Info, or TeX.
* Raw Formatter Commands::      Using raw TeX or HTML commands.
* set clear value::             Designating which text to format (for
                                  all output formats); and how to set a
                                  flag to a string that you can insert.
