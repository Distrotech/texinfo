6.3.5 The First Node
--------------------

The first node of a Texinfo file is the Top node, except in an
included file (see Include Files).  The Top node should contain a
short summary, copying permissions, and a master menu.  See The Top Node, for more information on the Top node contents and examples.

Here is a description of the node pointers to be used in the Top node:

* The Top node (which must be named `top' or `Top') should have
as its `Up' node the name of a node in another file, where there is a
menu that leads to this file.  Specify the file name in parentheses.

Usually, all Info files are installed in the same Info directory tree;
in this case, use `(dir)' as the parent of the Top node; this is
short for `(dir)top', and specifies the Top node in the `dir'
file, which contains the main menu for the Info system as a whole. 

* On the other hand, do not define the `Previous' node of the Top node to
be `(dir)', as it causes confusing behavior for users: if you are
in the Top node and hits <DEL> to go backwards, you wind up in the
middle of the some other entry in the `dir' file, which has nothing
to do with what you were reading.

* The `Next' node of the Top node should be the first chapter in your
document.


See Installing an Info File, for more information about installing
an Info file in the `info' directory.

For concreteness, here is an example with explicit pointers (which you
can maintain automatically with the texinfo mode commands):

Or you can leave the pointers off entirely and let the tools implicitly
define them.  This is recommended.  Thus:

@node Top
