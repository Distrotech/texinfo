11.2 @enumerate: Making a Numbered or Lettered List
===================================================

@enumerate is like @itemize (see @itemize), except that the labels on the items are
successive integers or letters instead of bullets.

Write the @enumerate command at the beginning of a line.  The
command does not require an argument, but accepts either a number or a
letter as an option.  Without an argument, @enumerate starts the
list with the number `1'.  With a numeric argument, such as
`3', the command starts the list with that number.  With an upper
or lower case letter, such as `a' or `A', the command starts
the list with that letter.

Write the text of the enumerated list in the same way you write an
itemized list: put @item on a line of its own before the start
of each paragraph that you want enumerated.  Do not write any other text
on the line beginning with @item.

You should put a blank line between entries in the list.
This generally makes it easier to read the Info file.

Here is an example of @enumerate without an argument:

@enumerate
@item
Underlying causes.

@item
Proximate causes.
@end enumerate

This produces:

1. Underlying causes.

2. Proximate causes.

Here is an example with an argument of 3:

@enumerate 3
@item
Predisposing causes.

@item
Precipitating causes.

@item
Perpetuating causes.
@end enumerate

This produces:

3. Predisposing causes.

4. Precipitating causes.

5. Perpetuating causes.

Here is a brief summary of the alternatives.  The summary is constructed
using @enumerate with an argument of a.

a. @enumerate

Without an argument, produce a numbered list, starting with the number
1.

b. @enumerate positive-integer

With a (positive) numeric argument, start a numbered list with that
number.  You can use this to continue a list that you interrupted with
other text.

c. @enumerate upper-case-letter

With an upper case letter as argument, start a list
in which each item is marked
by a letter, beginning with that upper case letter.

d. @enumerate lower-case-letter

With a lower case letter as argument, start a list
in which each item is marked by
a letter, beginning with that lower case letter.

You can also nest enumerated lists, as in an outline.
