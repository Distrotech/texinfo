F.4 Using occur
===============

Sometimes the texinfo-show-structure command produces too much
information.  Perhaps you want to remind yourself of the overall structure
of a Texinfo file, and are overwhelmed by the detailed list produced by
texinfo-show-structure.  In this case, you can use the occur
command directly.  To do this, type

M-x occur

and then, when prompted, type a regexp, a regular expression for
the pattern you want to match.  (See (emacs)Regexps section `Regular Expressions' in The GNU Emacs Manual.)  The occur command works from
the current location of the cursor in the buffer to the end of the
buffer.  If you want to run occur on the whole buffer, place
the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.

For example, to see all the lines that contain the word
`@chapter' in them, just type `@chapter'.  This will
produce a list of the chapters.  It will also list all the sentences
with `@chapter' in the middle of the line.

If you want to see only those lines that start with the word
`@chapter', type `^@chapter' when prompted by
occur.  If you want to see all the lines that end with a word
or phrase, end the last word with a `$'; for example,
`catching mistakes$'.  This can be helpful when you want to see
all the nodes that are part of the same chapter or section and
therefore have the same `Up' pointer.

See (emacs)Other Repeating Search section `Using Occur' in The GNU Emacs Manual,
for more information.
