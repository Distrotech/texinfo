1.7 Comments
============


You can write comments in a Texinfo file that will not appear in
either the Info file or the printed manual by using the
@comment command (which may be abbreviated to @c).
Such comments are for the person who revises the Texinfo file.  All the
text on a line that follows either @comment or @c is a
comment; the rest of the line does not appear in either the Info file
or the printed manual.

Often, you can write the @comment or @c in the middle of
a line, and only the text that follows after the @comment or
@c command does not appear; but some commands, such as
@settitle and @setfilename, work on a whole line.  You
cannot use @comment or @c in a line beginning with such
a command.

You can write long stretches of text that will not appear in either
the Info file or the printed manual by using the @ignore and
@end ignore commands.  Write each of these commands on a line
of its own, starting each command at the beginning of the line.  Text
between these two commands does not appear in the processed output.
You can use @ignore and @end ignore for writing
comments.

Text enclosed by @ignore or by failing @ifset or
@ifclear conditions is ignored in the sense that it will not
contribute to the formatted output.  However, TeX and makeinfo must
still parse the ignored text, in order to understand when to stop
ignoring text from the source file; that means that you may still get
error messages if you have invalid Texinfo commands within ignored text.
