10 Quotations and Examples
**************************

Quotations and examples are blocks of text consisting of one or more
whole paragraphs that are set off from the bulk of the text and
treated differently.  They are usually indented.

In Texinfo, you always begin a quotation or example by writing an
@-command at the beginning of a line by itself, and end it by writing
an @end command that is also at the beginning of a line by
itself.  For instance, you begin an example by writing @example
by itself at the beginning of a line and end the example by writing
@end example on a line by itself, at the beginning of that
line.
