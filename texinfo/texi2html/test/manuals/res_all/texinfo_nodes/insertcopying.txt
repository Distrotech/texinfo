3.3.2 @insertcopying: Include permissions text
----------------------------------------------

The @insertcopying command is simply written on a line by
itself, like this:

@insertcopying

It inserts the text previously defined by @copying.  Legally, it
must be used on the copyright page in the printed manual
(see Copyright).

Although it's not a legal requirement, we also strongly recommend using
@insertcopying in the Top node of your manual (see The Top Node).  Here's why:

The @copying command itself causes the permissions text to
appear in an Info file before the first node.  The text is also
copied into the beginning of each split Info output file, as is legally
necessary.  This location implies a human reading the manual using Info
does not see this text (except when using the advanced Info
command g *).  Therefore, an explicit @insertcopying
in the Top node makes it apparent to readers that the manual is free.

Similarly, the @copying text is automatically included at the
beginning of each HTML output file, as an HTML comment.  Again, this
text is not visible (unless the reader views the HTML source).  And
therefore again, the @insertcopying in the Top node is valuable
because it makes the copying permissions visible and thus promotes
freedom.

The permissions text defined by @copying also appears
automatically at the beginning of the XML output file.
