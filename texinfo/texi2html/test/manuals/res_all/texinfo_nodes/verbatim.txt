10.4 @verbatim: Literal Text
============================

Use the @verbatim environment for printing of text that may
contain special characters or commands that should not be interpreted,
such as computer input or output (@example interprets its text
as regular Texinfo commands).  This is especially useful for including
automatically generated output in a Texinfo manual.  Here is an example;
the output you see is just the same as the input, with a line
@verbatim before and a line @end verbatim after.

This is an example of text written in a @verbatim
block.  No character substitutions are made.  All commands
are ignored, until `<at>end verbatim'.

In the printed manual, the text is typeset in a
fixed-width font, and not indented or filled.  All
spaces and blank lines are significant, including tabs.

Write a @verbatim command at the beginning of a line by itself.
This line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the verbatim
block with a @end verbatim command, also written at the
beginning of a line by itself.  The @end verbatim will also
disappear from the output.

For example:

@verbatim
{
<tab>@command with strange characters: @'e 
expand<tab>me
}
@end verbatim

produces

{
	@command with strange characters: @'e 
expand	me
}

Since the lines containing @verbatim and @end verbatim
produce no output, tyically you should put a blank line before the
@verbatim and another blank line after the @end
verbatim.  Blank lines between the beginning @verbatim and the
ending @end verbatim will appear in the output.
