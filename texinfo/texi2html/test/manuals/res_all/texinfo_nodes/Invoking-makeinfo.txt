20.1.2 Running makeinfo from a Shell
------------------------------------

To create an Info file from a Texinfo file, type makeinfo
followed by the name of the Texinfo file.  Thus, to create the Info
file for Bison, type the following to the shell:

makeinfo bison.texinfo

(You can run a shell inside Emacs by typing M-x shell.)

Sometimes you will want to specify options.  For example, if you wish
to discover which version of makeinfo you are using,
type:

makeinfo --version

See makeinfo options, for more information.
