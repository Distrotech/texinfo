3.3 Document Permissions
========================

The copyright notice and copying permissions for a document need to
appear in several places in the various Texinfo output formats.
Therefore, Texinfo provides a command (@copying) to declare
this text once, and another command (@insertcopying) to
insert the text at appropriate points.

* copying::                 Declare the document's copying permissions.
* insertcopying::           Where to insert the permissions.
