Break Commands
==============

The break commands create or allow line and paragraph breaks:

@*
Force a line break.

@sp n
Skip n blank lines.

@-
Insert a discretionary hyphen.

@hyphenation{hy-phen-a-ted words}
Define hyphen points in hy-phen-a-ted words.

The line-break-prevention command holds text together all on one
line:

@w{text}
Prevent text from being split and hyphenated across two lines.

The pagination commands apply only to printed output, since Info
files do not have pages.

@page
Start a new page in the printed manual.

@group
Hold text together that must appear on one printed page.

@need mils
Start a new printed page if not enough space on this one.
