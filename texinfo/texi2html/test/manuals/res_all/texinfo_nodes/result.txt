13.9.2 @result{} (=>): Indicating Evaluation
--------------------------------------------

Use the @result{} command to indicate the result of
evaluating an expression.

The @result{} command is displayed as `=>' in Info
and as a double stemmed arrow in the printed output.

Thus, the following,

(cdr '(1 2 3))
     => (2 3)

may be read as "(cdr '(1 2 3)) evaluates to (2 3)".
