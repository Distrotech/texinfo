9.1.9 @command{command-name}
----------------------------

Use the @command command to indicate command names, such as
ls or cc.

@command is equivalent to @code in its effects.
For example:

The command @command{ls} lists directory contents.
produces
The command ls lists directory contents.

You should write the name of a program in the ordinary text font, rather
than using @command, if you regard it as a new English word,
such as `Emacs' or `Bison'.

When writing an entire shell command invocation, as in `ls -l',
you should use either @samp or @code at your discretion.
