7.5 Referring to Other Info Files
=================================

You can create a menu entry that enables a reader in Info to go to a
node in another Info file by writing the file name in parentheses just
before the node name.  In this case, you should use the three-part menu
entry format, which saves the reader from having to type the file
name.

The format looks like this:

@menu
* first-entry-name:(filename)nodename.     description
* second-entry-name:(filename)second-node. description
@end menu

For example, to refer directly to the `Outlining' and
`Rebinding' nodes in the Emacs Manual, you would write a
menu like this:

@menu
* Outlining: (emacs)Outline Mode. The major mode for
                                  editing outlines.
* Rebinding: (emacs)Rebinding.    How to redefine the
                                  meaning of a key.
@end menu

If you do not list the node name, but only name the file, then Info
presumes that you are referring to the `Top' node.

The `dir' file that contains the main menu for Info has menu
entries that list only file names.  These take you directly to the `Top'
nodes of each Info document.  (See Installing an Info File.)

For example:

* Info: (info).         Documentation browsing system.
* Emacs: (emacs).       The extensible, self-documenting
                        text editor.

(The `dir' top level directory for the Info system is an Info file,
not a Texinfo file, but a menu entry looks the same in both types of
file.)

The GNU Emacs Texinfo mode menu updating commands only work with nodes
within the current buffer, so you cannot use them to create menus that
refer to other files.  You must write such menus by hand.
