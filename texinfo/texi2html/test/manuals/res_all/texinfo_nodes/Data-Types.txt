15.4.6 Data Types
-----------------

Here is the command for data types:

@deftp category name attributes...
The @deftp command is the generic definition command for data
types.  The command is written at the beginning of a line and is
followed on the same line by the category, by the name of the type
(which is a word like int or float), and then by names of
attributes of objects of that type.  Thus, you could use this command
for describing int or float, in which case you could use
data type as the category.  (A data type is a category of
certain objects for purposes of deciding which operations can be
performed on them.)

In Lisp, for example,  pair names a particular data
type, and an object of that type has two slots called the
CAR and the CDR.  Here is how you would write the first line
of a definition of pair.

@deftp {Data type} pair car cdr
...
@end deftp

The template is:

@deftp category name-of-type attributes...
body-of-definition
@end deftp

@deftp creates an entry in the index of data types.
