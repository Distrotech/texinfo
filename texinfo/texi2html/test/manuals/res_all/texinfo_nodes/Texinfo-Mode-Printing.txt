19.6 Formatting and Printing in Texinfo Mode
============================================

Texinfo mode provides several predefined key commands for TeX
formatting and printing.  These include commands for sorting indices,
looking at the printer queue, killing the formatting job, and
recentering the display of the buffer in which the operations
occur.

C-c C-t C-b
M-x texinfo-tex-buffer
Run texi2dvi on the current buffer.

C-c C-t C-r
M-x texinfo-tex-region
Run TeX on the current region.

C-c C-t C-i
M-x texinfo-texindex
Sort the indices of a Texinfo file formatted with
texinfo-tex-region.

C-c C-t C-p
M-x texinfo-tex-print
Print a DVI file that was made with texinfo-tex-region or
texinfo-tex-buffer.

C-c C-t C-q
M-x tex-show-print-queue
Show the print queue.

C-c C-t C-d
M-x texinfo-delete-from-print-queue
Delete a job from the print queue; you will be prompted for the job
number shown by a preceding C-c C-t C-q command
(texinfo-show-tex-print-queue).

C-c C-t C-k
M-x tex-kill-job
Kill the currently running TeX job started by either
texinfo-tex-region or texinfo-tex-buffer, or any other
process running in the Texinfo shell buffer.

C-c C-t C-x
M-x texinfo-quit-job
Quit a TeX formatting job that has stopped because of an error by
sending an <x> to it.  When you do this, TeX preserves a record
of what it did in a `.log' file.

C-c C-t C-l
M-x tex-recenter-output-buffer
Redisplay the shell buffer in which the TeX printing and formatting
commands are run to show its most recent output.

Thus, the usual sequence of commands for formatting a buffer is as
follows (with comments to the right):

C-c C-t C-b             Run texi2dvi on the buffer.
C-c C-t C-p             Print the DVI file.
C-c C-t C-q             Display the printer queue.

The Texinfo mode TeX formatting commands start a subshell in Emacs
called the `*tex-shell*'.  The texinfo-tex-command,
texinfo-texindex-command, and tex-dvi-print-command
commands are all run in this shell.

You can watch the commands operate in the `*tex-shell*' buffer,
and you can switch to and from and use the `*tex-shell*' buffer
as you would any other shell buffer.

The formatting and print commands depend on the values of several variables.
The default values are:

     Variable                              Default value

texinfo-texi2dvi-command                  "texi2dvi"
texinfo-tex-command                       "tex"
texinfo-texindex-command                  "texindex"
texinfo-delete-from-print-queue-command   "lprm"
texinfo-tex-trailer                       "@bye"
tex-start-of-header                       "%**start"
tex-end-of-header                         "%**end"
tex-dvi-print-command                     "lpr -d"
tex-show-queue-command                    "lpq"

You can change the values of these variables with the M-x
edit-options command (see Editing Variable Values in The GNU Emacs Manual), with the M-x set-variable command
(see Examining and Setting Variables in The GNU Emacs Manual), or with your `.emacs' initialization file
(see Init File in The GNU Emacs Manual).

Beginning with version 20, GNU Emacs offers a user-friendly interface,
called Customize, for changing values of user-definable variables.
See Easy Customization Interface in The GNU Emacs Manual, for more details about this.  The Texinfo variables can
be found in the `Development/Docs/Texinfo' group, once you invoke
the M-x customize command.
