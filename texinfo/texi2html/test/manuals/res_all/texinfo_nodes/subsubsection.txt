5.11 The `subsub' Commands
==========================

The fourth and lowest level sectioning commands in Texinfo are the
`subsub' commands.  They are:

@subsubsection
Subsubsections are to subsections as subsections are to sections.
(See @subsection.)  In a printed manual,
subsubsection titles appear in the table of contents and are numbered
four levels deep.

@unnumberedsubsubsec
Unnumbered subsubsection titles appear in the table of contents of a
printed manual, but lack numbers.  Otherwise, unnumbered
subsubsections are the same as subsubsections.  In Info, unnumbered
subsubsections look exactly like ordinary subsubsections.

@appendixsubsubsec
Conventionally, appendix commands are used only for appendices and are
lettered and numbered appropriately in a printed manual.  They also
appear in the table of contents.  In Info, appendix subsubsections look
exactly like ordinary subsubsections.

@subsubheading
The @subsubheading command may be used anywhere that you need
a small heading that will not appear in the table of contents.  In
Info, subsubheadings look exactly like ordinary subsubsection
headings.

In Info,  `subsub' titles are underlined with periods.
For example,

@subsubsection This is a subsubsection

produces

This is a subsubsection
