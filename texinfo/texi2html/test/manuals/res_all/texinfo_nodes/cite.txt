9.1.12 @cite{reference}
-----------------------

Use the @cite command for the name of a book that lacks a
companion Info file.  The command produces italics in the printed
manual, and quotation marks in the Info file.

If a book is written in Texinfo, it is better to use a cross reference
command since a reader can easily follow such a reference in Info.
See @xref.
