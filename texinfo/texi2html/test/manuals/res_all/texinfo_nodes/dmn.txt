13.2.4 @dmn{dimension}: Format a Dimension
------------------------------------------

At times, you may want to write `12pt' or
`8.5in' with little or no space between the number and the
abbreviation for the dimension.  You can use the @dmn command
to do this.  On seeing the command, TeX inserts just enough space
for proper typesetting; the Info formatting commands insert no space
at all, since the Info file does not require it.

To use the @dmn command, write the number and then follow it
immediately, with no intervening space, by @dmn, and then by
the dimension within braces.  For example,

A4 paper is 8.27@dmn{in} wide.

produces

A4 paper is 8.27in wide.

Not everyone uses this style.  Some people prefer `8.27 in.@:'
or `8.27 inches' to `8.27@dmn{in}' in the Texinfo file.
In these cases, however, the formatters may insert a line break between
the number and the dimension, so use @w (see w).  Also, if
you write a period after an abbreviation within a sentence, you should
write `@:' after the period to prevent TeX from inserting extra
whitespace, as shown here.  See Not Ending a Sentence.
