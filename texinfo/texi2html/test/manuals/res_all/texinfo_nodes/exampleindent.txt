3.6.4 @exampleindent: Environment Indenting
-------------------------------------------

The Texinfo processors indent each line of @example and similar
environments.  You can use the @exampleindent command to specify
this indentation.  Write an @exampleindent command at the
beginning of a line followed by either `asis' or a number:

@exampleindent indent

The indentation is according to the value of indent:

asis
Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in TeX).

0
Omit all indentation.

n
Indent environments by n space characters in Info output, by
n ems in TeX.


The default value of indent is 5.  @exampleindent is
ignored for HTML output.

It is best to write the @exampleindent command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  See Start of Header.
