16.4.1 @set and @value
----------------------

You use the @set command to specify a value for a flag, which is
later expanded by the @value command.

A flag is an identifier.  In general, it is best to use only
letters and numerals in a flag name, not `-' or `_'--they
will work in some contexts, but not all, due to limitations in TeX.

The value is the remainder of the input line, and can contain anything.

Write the @set command like this:

@set foo This is a string.

This sets the value of the flag foo to "This is a string.".

The Texinfo formatters then replace an @value{flag}
command with the string to which flag is set.  Thus, when
foo is set as shown above, the Texinfo formatters convert this:

@value{foo}
to this:
This is a string.

You can write an @value command within a paragraph; but you
must write an @set command on a line of its own.

If you write the @set command like this:

@set foo

without specifying a string, the value of foo is the empty string.

If you clear a previously set flag with @clear flag, a
subsequent @value{flag} command will report an error.

For example, if you set foo as follows:

@set how-much very, very, very

then the formatters transform

It is a @value{how-much} wet day.
into
It is a very, very, very wet day.

If you write

@clear how-much

then the formatters transform

It is a @value{how-much} wet day.
into
It is a {No value for "how-much"} wet day.
