1 Overview of Texinfo
*********************

Texinfo(1)  is a documentation system that uses a single
source file to produce both online information and printed output.  This
means that instead of writing two different documents, one for the
online information and the other for a printed work, you need write only
one document.  Therefore, when the work is revised, you need revise only
that one document.
