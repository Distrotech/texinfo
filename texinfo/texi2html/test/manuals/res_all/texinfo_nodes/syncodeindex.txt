12.4.1 @syncodeindex
--------------------

When you want to combine functions and concepts into one index, you
should index the functions with @findex and index the concepts
with @cindex, and use the @syncodeindex command to
redirect the function index entries into the concept index.

The @syncodeindex command takes two arguments; they are the name
of the index to redirect, and the name of the index to redirect it to.
The template looks like this:

@syncodeindex from to

For this purpose, the indices are given two-letter names:

`cp'
concept index
`fn'
function index
`vr'
variable index
`ky'
key index
`pg'
program index
`tp'
data type index

Write an @syncodeindex command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  For example,
to merge a function index with a concept index, write the
following:

@syncodeindex fn cp

This will cause all entries designated for the function index to merge
in with the concept index instead.

To merge both a variables index and a function index into a concept
index, write the following:

@syncodeindex vr cp
@syncodeindex fn cp

The @syncodeindex command puts all the entries from the `from'
index (the redirected index) into the @code font, overriding
whatever default font is used by the index to which the entries are
now directed.  This way, if you direct function names from a function
index into a concept index, all the function names are printed in the
@code font as you would expect.
