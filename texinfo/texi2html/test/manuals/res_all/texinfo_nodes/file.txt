9.1.8 @file{file-name}
----------------------

Use the @file command to indicate text that is the name of a
file, buffer, or directory, or is the name of a node in Info.  You can
also use the command for file name suffixes.  Do not use @file
for symbols in a programming language; use @code.

Currently, @file is equivalent to @samp in its effects.
For example,

The @file{.el} files are in
the @file{/usr/local/emacs/lisp} directory.

produces

The `.el' files are in
the `/usr/local/emacs/lisp' directory.
