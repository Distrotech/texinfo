5.7 @section
============

In a printed manual, an @section command identifies a
numbered section within a chapter.  The section title appears in the
table of contents.  In Info, an @section command provides a
title for a segment of text, underlined with `='.

This section is headed with an @section command and looks like
this in the Texinfo file:

@section @code{@@section}

To create a section, write the @section command at the
beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by the section
title.

Thus,

@section This is a section

produces

This is a section
=================

in Info.
