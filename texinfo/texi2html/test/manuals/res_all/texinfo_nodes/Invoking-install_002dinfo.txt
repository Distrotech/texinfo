20.2.5 Invoking install-info
----------------------------


install-info inserts menu entries from an Info file into the
top-level `dir' file in the Info system (see the previous sections
for an explanation of how the `dir' file works).  It's most often
run as part of software installation, or when constructing a `dir' file
for all manuals on a system.  Synopsis:

install-info [option]... [info-file [dir-file]]

If info-file or dir-file are not specified, the options
(described below) that define them must be.  There are no compile-time
defaults, and standard input is never used.  install-info can
read only one Info file and write only one `dir' file per invocation.

If dir-file (however specified) does not exist,
install-info creates it if possible (with no entries).

If any input file is compressed with gzip (see Invoking gzip in Gzip), install-info automatically uncompresses it
for reading.  And if dir-file is compressed, install-info
also automatically leaves it compressed after writing any changes.
If dir-file itself does not exist, install-info tries to
open `dir-file.gz'.

Options:

--delete
Delete the entries in info-file from dir-file.  The file
name in the entry in dir-file must be info-file (except for
an optional `.info' in either one).  Don't insert any new entries.

--dir-file=name
-d name
Specify file name of the Info directory file.  This is equivalent to
using the dir-file argument.

--entry=text
-e text
Insert text as an Info directory entry; text should have the
form of an Info menu item line plus zero or more extra lines starting
with whitespace.  If you specify more than one entry, they are all
added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are determined from
information in the Info file itself.

--help
-h
Display a usage message listing basic usage and all available options,
then exit successfully.

--info-file=file
-i file
Specify Info file to install in the directory.
Equivalent to using the info-file argument.

--info-dir=dir
-D dir
Specify the directory where `dir' resides.
Equivalent to `--dir-file=dir/dir'.

--item=text
Same as `--entry=text'.  An Info directory entry is actually
a menu item.

--quiet
Suppress warnings.

--remove
-r
Same as `--delete'.

--section=sec
-s sec
Put this file's entries in section sec of the directory.  If you
specify more than one section, all the entries are added in each of the
sections.  If you don't specify any sections, they are determined from
information in the Info file itself.

--version
-V
Display version information and exit successfully.
