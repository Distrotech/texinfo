2.6 Formatting and Printing
===========================

Typesetting and printing a Texinfo file is a multi-step process in which
you first create a file for printing (called a DVI file), and then
print the file.  Optionally, you may also create indices.  To do this,
you must run the texindex command after first running the
tex typesetting command; and then you must run the tex
command again.  Or else run the texi2dvi command which
automatically creates indices as needed (see Format with texi2dvi).

Often, when you are writing a document, you want to typeset and print
only part of a file to see what it will look like.  You can use the
texinfo-tex-region and related commands for this purpose.  Use
the texinfo-tex-buffer command to format all of a
buffer.

C-c C-t C-b
M-x texinfo-tex-buffer
Run texi2dvi on the buffer.  In addition to running TeX on the
buffer, this command automatically creates or updates indices as
needed.

C-c C-t C-r
M-x texinfo-tex-region
Run TeX on the region.

C-c C-t C-i
M-x texinfo-texindex
Run texindex to sort the indices of a Texinfo file formatted with
texinfo-tex-region.  The texinfo-tex-region command does
not run texindex automatically; it only runs the tex
typesetting command.  You must run the texinfo-tex-region command
a second time after sorting the raw index files with the texindex
command.  (Usually, you do not format an index when you format a region,
only when you format a buffer.  Now that the texi2dvi command
exists, there is little or no need for this command.)

C-c C-t C-p
M-x texinfo-tex-print
Print the file (or the part of the file) previously formatted with
texinfo-tex-buffer or texinfo-tex-region.

For texinfo-tex-region or texinfo-tex-buffer to work, the
file must start with a `\input texinfo' line and must
include an @settitle line.  The file must end with @bye
on a line by itself.  (When you use texinfo-tex-region, you must
surround the @settitle line with start-of-header and
end-of-header lines.)

See Hardcopy, for a description of the other TeX related
commands, such as tex-show-print-queue.
