9.2.1 @emph{text} and @strong{text}
-----------------------------------

The @emph and @strong commands are for emphasis;
@strong is stronger.  In printed output, @emph produces
italics and @strong produces bold.

For example,

@quotation
@strong{Caution:} @samp{rm * .[^.]*} removes @emph{all}
files in the directory.
@end quotation

produces:

     *Caution*: `rm * .[^.]*' removes _all_
     files in the directory.

The @strong command is seldom used except to mark what is, in
effect, a typographical element, such as the word `Caution' in the
preceding example.

In the Info output, @emph surrounds the text with underscores
(`_'), and @strong puts asterisks around the text.

Caution: Do not use @strong with the word `Note';
Info will mistake the combination for a cross reference.  Use a phrase
such as Please note or Caution instead.
