20.2.2 Listing a New Info File
------------------------------

To add a new Info file to your system, you must write a menu entry to
add to the menu in the `dir' file in the `info' directory.
For example, if you were adding documentation for GDB, you would write
the following new entry:

* GDB: (gdb).           The source-level C debugger.

The first part of the menu entry is the menu entry name, followed by a
colon.  The second part is the name of the Info file, in parentheses,
followed by a period.  The third part is the description.

The name of an Info file often has a `.info' extension.  Thus, the
Info file for GDB might be called either `gdb' or `gdb.info'.
The Info reader programs automatically try the file name both with and
without `.info'(11); so it is better to avoid
clutter and not to write `.info' explicitly in the menu entry.  For
example, the GDB menu entry should use just `gdb' for the file
name, not `gdb.info'.
