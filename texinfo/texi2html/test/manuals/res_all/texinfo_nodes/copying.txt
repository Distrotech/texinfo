3.3.1 @copying: Declare copying permissions
-------------------------------------------

The @copying command should be given very early in the document;
right after the header material (see Texinfo File Header) is the
recommended location.  It conventionally consists of a sentence or two
about what the program is, the legal copyright line, and the copying
permissions.  Here is a skeletal example:

@copying
This manual is for program (version version),
which ...

Copyright @copyright{} years copyright-owner.

@quotation
Permission is granted to ...
@end quotation
@end copying

The @quotation has no legal significance; it's there to improve
readability in some contexts.

See GNU Sample Texts, for the full text to be used in GNU manuals.
See GNU Free Documentation License, for the license itself under
which GNU and other free manuals are distributed.

The text of @copying is output as a comment at the beginning of
Info, HTML, and XML output files.  It is not output implicitly in
plain text or TeX; it's up to you to use @insertcopying to
emit the copying information.  See the next section for details.

In output formats that support it (print and HTML), the
@copyright{} command generates a `c' inside a circle.  In
Info and plain text, it generates `(C)'.  The copyright notice
itself has the following legally defined sequence:

Copyright (C) years copyright-owner.

The word `Copyright' must always be written in English, even if the
manual is otherwise in another language.  This is due to international
law.

The list of years should include all years in which a version was
completed (even if it was released in a subsequent year).  Ranges are
not allowed, each year must be written out individually, separated by
commas.

The copyright owner (or owners) is whoever holds legal copyright on the
work.  In the case of works assigned to the FSF, the owner is `Free
Software Foundation, Inc.'.
