10.9 @format and @smallformat
=============================

The @format command is similar to @example except
that, in the printed manual, @format does not select the
fixed-width font and does not narrow the margins.

This is an example of text written between an @format command
and an @end format command.  As you can see
from this example,
the @format command does not fill the text.

Texinfo also provides a command @smallformat, which is like
@format but uses a smaller font in @smallbook format.
See small.
