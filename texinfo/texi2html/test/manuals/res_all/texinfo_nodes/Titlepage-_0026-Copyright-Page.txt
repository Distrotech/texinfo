3.4 Title and Copyright Pages
=============================

In hard copy output, the manual's name and author are usually printed on
a title page.  Copyright information is usually printed on the back of
the title page.

The title and copyright pages appear in the printed manual, but not in
the Info file.  Because of this, it is possible to use several slightly
obscure TeX typesetting commands that cannot be used in an Info file.
In addition, this part of the beginning of a Texinfo file contains the
text of the copying permissions that appears in the printed manual.

You may wish to include titlepage-like information for plain text
output.  Simply place any such leading material between
@ifplaintext and @end ifplaintext; makeinfo
includes this when writing plain text (`--no-headers'), along with
an @insertcopying.

* titlepage::                   Create a title for the printed document.

                                  and @author commands.

                                  include copying permissions.
* end titlepage::               Turn on page headings after the title and
                                  copyright pages.
