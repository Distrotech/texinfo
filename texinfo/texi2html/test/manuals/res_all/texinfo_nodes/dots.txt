13.4.1 @dots{} (...) and @enddots{} (...)
-----------------------------------------

Use the @dots{} command to generate an ellipsis, which is
three dots in a row, appropriately spaced, like this: `...'.  Do
not simply write three periods in the input file; that would work for
the Info file output, but would produce the wrong amount of space
between the periods in the printed manual.

Similarly, the @enddots{} command generates an
end-of-sentence ellipsis (four dots) ...
