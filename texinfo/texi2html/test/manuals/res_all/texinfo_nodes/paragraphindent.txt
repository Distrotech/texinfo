3.6.3 Paragraph Indenting
-------------------------

The Texinfo processors may insert whitespace at the beginning of the
first line of each paragraph, thereby indenting that paragraph.  You can
use the @paragraphindent command to specify this indentation.
Write an @paragraphindent command at the beginning of a line
followed by either `asis' or a number:

@paragraphindent indent

The indentation is according to the value of indent:

asis
Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in TeX).

none
0
Omit all indentation.

n
Indent by n space characters in Info output, by n ems in
TeX.


The default value of indent is 3.  @paragraphindent is
ignored for HTML output.

It is best to write the @paragraphindent command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  See Start of Header.

A peculiarity of the texinfo-format-buffer and
texinfo-format-region commands is that they do not indent (nor
fill) paragraphs that contain @w or @* commands.
See Refilling Paragraphs, for further information.
