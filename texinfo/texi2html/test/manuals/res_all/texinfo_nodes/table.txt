Using the @table Command
------------------------

Use the @table command to produce two-column tables.

Write the @table command at the beginning of a line and follow
it on the same line with an argument that is a Texinfo "indicating"
command such as @code, @samp, @var, or
@kbd (see Indicating).  Although these commands are usually
followed by arguments in braces, in this case you use the command name
without an argument because @item will supply the argument.
This command will be applied to the text that goes into the first column
of each item and determines how it will be highlighted.  For example,
@code will cause the text in the first column to be highlighted
with an @code command.  (We recommend @code for
@table's of command-line options.)

You may also choose to use the @asis command as an argument to
@table.  @asis is a command that does nothing; if you
use this command after @table, TeX and the Info formatting
commands output the first column entries without added highlighting
("as is").

(The @table command may work with other commands besides those
listed here.  However, you can only use commands that normally take
arguments in braces.)

Begin each table entry with an @item command at the beginning
of a line.  Write the first column text on the same line as the
@item command.  Write the second column text on the line
following the @item line and on subsequent lines.  (You do not
need to type anything for an empty second column entry.)  You may
write as many lines of supporting text as you wish, even several
paragraphs.  But only text on the same line as the @item will
be placed in the first column, including any footnote.

Normally, you should put a blank line before an @item line.
This puts a blank like in the Info file.  Except when the entries are
very brief, a blank line looks better.

The following table, for example, highlights the text in the first
column with an @samp command:

@table @samp
@item foo
This is the text for
@samp{foo}.

@item bar
Text for @samp{bar}.
@end table

This produces:

`foo'
This is the text for
`foo'.
`bar'
Text for `bar'.

If you want to list two or more named items with a single block of
text, use the @itemx command.  (See @itemx.)
