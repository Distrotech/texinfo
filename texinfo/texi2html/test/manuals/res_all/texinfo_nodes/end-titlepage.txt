3.4.5 Heading Generation
------------------------

The @end titlepage command must be written on a line by itself.
It not only marks the end of the title and copyright pages, but also
causes TeX to start generating page headings and page numbers.

To repeat what is said elsewhere,  Texinfo has two standard page heading
formats, one for documents which are printed on one side of each sheet of paper
(single-sided printing), and the other for documents which are printed on both
sides of each sheet (double-sided printing).
You can specify these formats in different ways:

* The conventional way is to write an @setchapternewpage command
before the title page commands, and then have the @end
titlepage command start generating page headings in the manner desired.
(See setchapternewpage.)

* Alternatively, you can use the @headings command to prevent page
headings from being generated or to start them for either single or
double-sided printing.  (Write an @headings command immediately
after the @end titlepage command.  See The @headings Command, for more information.)

* Or, you may specify your own page heading and footing format.
See Page Headings, for detailed
information about page headings and footings.

Most documents are formatted with the standard single-sided or
double-sided format, using @setchapternewpage odd for
double-sided printing and no @setchapternewpage command for
single-sided printing.
