1.1 Reporting Bugs
==================

We welcome bug reports and suggestions for any aspect of the Texinfo system,
programs, documentation, installation, anything.  Please email them to
<mailto:bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.  You can get the latest version of Texinfo
from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/> and its mirrors worldwide.

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

* the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) or manual(s) involved.
* hardware and operating system names and versions.
* the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
* a description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
* any unusual options you gave to configure.
* anything else that you think would be helpful.

When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
better to include too much than to leave out something important.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with
`diff -c' (see (diffutils)Top section `Overview' in Comparing and Merging Files) and include `ChangeLog' entries (see (emacs)Change Log section `Change Log' in The GNU Emacs Manual).

When sending patches, if possible please do not encode or split them in
any way; it's much easier to deal with one plain text message, however
large, than many small ones.  GNU shar <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sharutils/> is a convenient way of packaging multiple and/or binary files
for email.
