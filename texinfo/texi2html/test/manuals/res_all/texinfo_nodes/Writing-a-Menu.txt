7.1 Writing a Menu
==================

A menu consists of an @menu command on a line by
itself followed by menu entry lines or menu comment lines
and then by an @end menu command on a line by
itself.

A menu looks like this:

@menu
Larger Units of Text

* Files::                       All about handling files.
* Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                  several files at once.
@end menu

In a menu, every line that begins with an `* ' is a menu
entry.  (Note the space after the asterisk.)  A line that does not
start with an `* ' may also appear in a menu.  Such a line is
not a menu entry but is a menu comment line that appears in the Info
file.  In the example above, the line `Larger Units of Text' is a
menu comment line; the two lines starting with `* ' are menu
entries.  Space characters in a menu are preserved as-is; this allows
you to format the menu as you wish.
