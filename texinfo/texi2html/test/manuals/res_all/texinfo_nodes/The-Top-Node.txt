3.5 The `Top' Node and Master Menu
==================================

The `Top' node is the node in which a reader enters an Info manual.  As
such, it should begin with the @insertcopying command
(see Document Permissions) to provide a brief description of the
manual (including the version number) and copying permissions, and end
with a master menu for the whole manual.  Of course you should include
any other general information you feel a reader would find helpful.

It is also conventional to write an @top sectioning command line
containing the title of the document immediately after the @node
Top line (see The @top Sectioning Command).

The contents of the `Top' node should appear only in the online output;
none of it should appear in printed output, so enclose it between
@ifnottex and @end ifnottex commands.  (TeX does not
print either an @node line or a menu; they appear only in Info;
strictly speaking, you are not required to enclose these parts between
@ifnottex and @end ifnottext, but it is simplest to do
so.  See Conditionally Visible Text.)
