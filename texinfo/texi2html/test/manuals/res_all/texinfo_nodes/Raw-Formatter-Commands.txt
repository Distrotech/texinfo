16.3 Raw Formatter Commands
===========================

Inside a region delineated by @iftex and @end iftex, you
can embed some raw TeX commands.  Info will ignore these commands
since they are only in that part of the file which is seen by TeX.
You can write the TeX commands as you would write them in a normal
TeX file, except that you must replace the `\' used by TeX
with an `@'.  For example, in the @titlepage section of a
Texinfo file, you can use the TeX command @vskip to format
the copyright page.  (The @titlepage command causes Info to
ignore the region automatically, as it does with the @iftex
command.)

However, many features of plain TeX will not work, as they are
overridden by Texinfo features.

You can enter plain TeX completely, and use `\' in the TeX
commands, by delineating a region with the @tex and @end
tex commands.  (The @tex command also causes Info to ignore the
region, like the @iftex command.)  The sole exception is that the
@ character still introduces a command, so that @end tex
can be recognized properly.

For example, here is a mathematical expression written in
plain TeX:

@tex
$$ \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N
          \left (y_i - (a + b x_i)
          \over \sigma_i\right)^2 $$
@end tex

The output of this example will appear only in a printed manual.  If
you are reading this in Info, you will not see the equation that appears
in the printed manual.


Analogously, you can use @ifhtml ... @end ifhtml to delimit
a region to be included in HTML output only, and @html ...
@end html for a region of raw HTML (again, except that @ is
still the escape character, so the @end command can be
recognized.)
