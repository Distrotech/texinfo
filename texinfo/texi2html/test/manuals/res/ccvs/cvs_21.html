<h2 class="appendixsec">F.1 Partial list of error messages</h2>

<p>Here is a partial list of error messages that you may
see from <small>CVS</small>.  It is not a complete list&mdash;<small>CVS</small>
is capable of printing many, many error messages, often
with parts of them supplied by the operating system,
but the intention is to list the common and/or
potentially confusing error messages.
</p>
<p>The messages are alphabetical, but introductory text
such as &lsquo;<samp>cvs update: </samp>&rsquo; is not considered in
ordering them.
</p>
<p>In some cases the list includes messages printed by old
versions of <small>CVS</small> (partly because users may not be
sure which version of <small>CVS</small> they are using at any
particular moment).
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <code><var>file</var>:<var>line</var>: Assertion '<var>text</var>' failed</code></dt>
<dd><p>The exact format of this message may vary depending on
your system.  It indicates a bug in <small>CVS</small>, which can
be handled as described in <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs <var>command</var>: authorization failed: server <var>host</var> rejected access</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a generic response when trying to connect to a
pserver server which chooses not to provide a
specific reason for denying authorization.  Check that
the username and password specified are correct and
that the <code>CVSROOT</code> specified is allowed by &lsquo;<samp>--allow-root</samp>&rsquo;
in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;.  See <a href="cvs_2.html#Password-authenticated">Direct connection with password authentication</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs <var>command</var>: conflict: removed <var>file</var> was modified by second party</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message indicates that you removed a file, and
someone else modified it.  To resolve the conflict,
first run &lsquo;<samp>cvs add <var>file</var></samp>&rsquo;.  If desired, look
at the other party&rsquo;s modification to decide whether you
still want to remove it.  If you don&rsquo;t want to remove
it, stop here.  If you do want to remove it, proceed
with &lsquo;<samp>cvs remove <var>file</var></samp>&rsquo; and commit your
removal.

<dd><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">Operation not permitted
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This message has been happening in a non-reproducible,
occasional way when we run the client/server testsuite,
both on Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 and 4.1.  We haven&rsquo;t been
able to figure out what causes it, nor is it known
whether it is specific to linux (or even to this
particular machine!).  If the problem does occur on
other unices, &lsquo;<samp>Operation not permitted</samp>&rsquo; would be
likely to read &lsquo;<samp>Not owner</samp>&rsquo; or whatever the system
in question uses for the unix <code>EPERM</code> error.  If
you have any information to add, please let us know as
described in <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>.  If you experience this error
while using <small>CVS</small>, retrying the operation which
produced it should work fine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [server aborted]: Cannot check out files into the repository itself</code></dt>
<dd><p>The obvious cause for this message (especially for
non-client/server <small>CVS</small>) is that the <small>CVS</small> root
is, for example, &lsquo;<tt>/usr/local/cvsroot</tt>&rsquo; and you try
to check out files when you are in a subdirectory, such
as &lsquo;<tt>/usr/local/cvsroot/test</tt>&rsquo;.  However, there is a
more subtle cause, which is that the temporary
directory on the server is set to a subdirectory of the
root (which is also not allowed).  If this is the
problem, set the temporary directory to somewhere else,
for example &lsquo;<tt>/var/tmp</tt>&rsquo;; see <code>TMPDIR</code> in
<a href="cvs_19.html#Environment-variables">All environment variables which affect CVS</a>, for how to set the
temporary directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cannot commit files as 'root'</code></dt>
<dd><p>See &lsquo;<samp>'root' is not allowed to commit files</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory</code></dt>
<dd><p>This generally indicates a <small>CVS</small> internal error, and
can be handled as with other <small>CVS</small> bugs
(see section <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>).  Usually there is a workaround&mdash;the
exact nature of which would depend on the situation but
which hopefully could be figured out.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [init aborted]: cannot open CVS/Root: No such file or directory</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message is harmless.  Provided it is not
accompanied by other errors, the operation has
completed successfully.  This message should not occur
with current versions of <small>CVS</small>, but it is documented
here for the benefit of <small>CVS</small> 1.9 and older.

<dt> <code>cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file <var>file</var> to CVS/,,<var>file</var>: Invalid argument</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message has been reported as intermittently
happening with <small>CVS</small> 1.9 on Solaris 2.5.  The cause is
unknown; if you know more about what causes it, let us
know as described in <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [<var>command</var> aborted]: cannot start server via rcmd</code></dt>
<dd><p>This, unfortunately, is a rather nonspecific error
message which <small>CVS</small> 1.9 will print if you are
running the <small>CVS</small> client and it is having trouble
connecting to the server.  Current versions of <small>CVS</small>
should print a much more specific error message.  If
you get this message when you didn&rsquo;t mean to run the
client at all, you probably forgot to specify
<code>:local:</code>, as described in <a href="cvs_2.html#Repository">The Repository</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>ci: <var>file</var>,v: bad diff output line: Binary files - and /tmp/T2a22651 differ</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>CVS</small> 1.9 and older will print this message
when trying to check in a binary file if
<small>RCS</small> is not correctly installed.  Re-read the
instructions that came with your <small>RCS</small> distribution
and the <small>INSTALL</small> file in the <small>CVS</small>
distribution.  Alternately, upgrade to a current
version of <small>CVS</small>, which checks in files itself
rather than via <small>RCS</small>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs checkout: could not check out <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>With <small>CVS</small> 1.9, this can mean that the <code>co</code> program
(part of <small>RCS</small>) returned a failure.  It should be
preceded by another error message, however it has been
observed without another error message and the cause is
not well-understood.  With the current version of <small>CVS</small>,
which does not run <code>co</code>, if this message occurs
without another error message, it is definitely a <small>CVS</small>
bug (see section <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [login aborted]: could not find out home directory</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that you need to set the environment
variables that <small>CVS</small> uses to locate your home directory.
See the discussion of <code>HOME</code>, <code>HOMEDRIVE</code>, and <code>HOMEPATH</code> in
<a href="cvs_19.html#Environment-variables">All environment variables which affect CVS</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs update: could not merge revision <var>rev</var> of <var>file</var>: No such file or directory</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>CVS</small> 1.9 and older will print this message if there was
a problem finding the <code>rcsmerge</code> program.  Make
sure that it is in your <code>PATH</code>, or upgrade to a
current version of <small>CVS</small>, which does not require
an external <code>rcsmerge</code> program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [update aborted]: could not patch <var>file</var>: No such file or directory</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that there was a problem finding the
<code>patch</code> program.  Make sure that it is in your
<code>PATH</code>.  Note that despite appearances the message
is <em>not</em> referring to whether it can find <var>file</var>.
If both the client and the server are running a current
version of <small>CVS</small>, then there is no need for an
external patch program and you should not see this
message.  But if either client or server is running
<small>CVS</small> 1.9, then you need <code>patch</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs update: could not patch <var>file</var>; will refetch</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that for whatever reason the client was
unable to apply a patch that the server sent.  The
message is nothing to be concerned about, because
inability to apply the patch only slows things down and
has no effect on what <small>CVS</small> does.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>dying gasps from <var>server</var> unexpected</code></dt>
<dd><p>There is a known bug in the server for <small>CVS</small> 1.9.18
and older which can cause this.  For me, this was
reproducible if I used the &lsquo;<samp>-t</samp>&rsquo; global option.  It
was fixed by Andy Piper&rsquo;s 14 Nov 1997 change to
src/filesubr.c, if anyone is curious.
If you see the message,
you probably can just retry the operation which failed,
or if you have discovered information concerning its
cause, please let us know as described in <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>end of file from server (consult above messages if any)</code></dt>
<dd><p>The most common cause for this message is if you are
using an external <code>rsh</code> program and it exited with
an error.  In this case the <code>rsh</code> program should
have printed a message, which will appear before the
above message.  For more information on setting up a
<small>CVS</small> client and server, see <a href="cvs_2.html#Remote-repositories">Remote repositories</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [update aborted]: EOF in key in RCS file <var>file</var>,v</code></dt>
<dt> <code>cvs [checkout aborted]: EOF while looking for end of string in RCS file <var>file</var>,v</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that there is a syntax error in the given
<small>RCS</small> file.  Note that this might be true even if <small>RCS</small> can
read the file OK; <small>CVS</small> does more error checking of
errors in the RCS file.  That is why you may see this
message when upgrading from <small>CVS</small> 1.9 to <small>CVS</small>
1.10.  The likely cause for the original corruption is
hardware, the operating system, or the like.  Of
course, if you find a case in which <small>CVS</small> seems to
corrupting the file, by all means report it,
(see section <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>).
There are quite a few variations of this error message,
depending on exactly where in the <small>RCS</small> file <small>CVS</small>
finds the syntax error.
</p>
<a name="index-mkmodules"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs commit: Executing 'mkmodules'</code></dt>
<dd><p>This means that your repository is set up for a version
of <small>CVS</small> prior to <small>CVS</small> 1.8.  When using <small>CVS</small>
1.8 or later, the above message will be preceded by
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">cvs commit: Rebuilding administrative file database
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>If you see both messages, the database is being rebuilt
twice, which is unnecessary but harmless.  If you wish
to avoid the duplication, and you have no versions of
<small>CVS</small> 1.7 or earlier in use, remove <code>-i mkmodules</code>
every place it appears in your <code>modules</code>
file.  For more information on the <code>modules</code> file,
see <a href="cvs_18.html#modules">The modules file</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>missing author</code></dt>
<dd><p>Typically this can happen if you created an RCS file
with your username set to empty.  <small>CVS</small> will, bogusly,
create an illegal RCS file with no value for the author
field.  The solution is to make sure your username is
set to a non-empty value and re-create the RCS file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [checkout aborted]: no such tag <var>tag</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>This message means that <small>CVS</small> isn&rsquo;t familiar with
the tag <var>tag</var>.  Usually this means that you have
mistyped a tag name; however there are (relatively
obscure) cases in which <small>CVS</small> will require you to
try a few other <small>CVS</small> commands involving that tag,
before you find one which will cause <small>CVS</small> to update
the &lsquo;<tt>val-tags</tt>&rsquo; file; see discussion of val-tags in
<a href="cvs_2.html#File-permissions">File permissions</a>.  You only need to worry about
this once for a given tag; when a tag is listed in
&lsquo;<tt>val-tags</tt>&rsquo;, it stays there.  Note that using
&lsquo;<samp>-f</samp>&rsquo; to not require tag matches does not override
this check; see <a href="cvs_16.html#Common-options">Common command options</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>*PANIC* administration files missing</code></dt>
<dd><p>This typically means that there is a directory named
<small>CVS</small> but it does not contain the administrative files
which <small>CVS</small> puts in a CVS directory.  If the problem is
that you created a CVS directory via some mechanism
other than <small>CVS</small>, then the answer is simple, use a name
other than <small>CVS</small>.  If not, it indicates a <small>CVS</small> bug
(see section <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>rcs error: Unknown option: -x,v/</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message will be followed by a usage message for
<small>RCS</small>.  It means that you have an old version of
<small>RCS</small> (probably supplied with your operating
system), as well as an old version of <small>CVS</small>.
<small>CVS</small> 1.9.18 and earlier only work with <small>RCS</small> version 5 and
later; current versions of <small>CVS</small> do not run <small>RCS</small> programs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>cvs [server aborted]: received broken pipe signal</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message seems to be caused by a hard-to-track-down
bug in <small>CVS</small> or the systems it runs on (we don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t tracked it down yet!).  It seems to
happen only after a <small>CVS</small> command has completed, and
you should be able to just ignore the message.
However, if you have discovered information concerning its
cause, please let us know as described in <a href="cvs_23.html#BUGS">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>'root' is not allowed to commit files</code></dt>
<dd><p>When committing a permanent change, <small>CVS</small> makes a log entry of
who committed the change.  If you are committing the change logged
in as &quot;root&quot; (not under &quot;su&quot; or other root-priv giving program),
<small>CVS</small> cannot determine who is actually making the change.
As such, by default, <small>CVS</small> disallows changes to be committed by users
logged in as &quot;root&quot;.  (You can disable this option by passing the
<code>--enable-rootcommit</code> option to &lsquo;<tt>configure</tt>&rsquo; and recompiling <small>CVS</small>.
On some systems this means editing the appropriate &lsquo;<tt>config.h</tt>&rsquo; file
before building <small>CVS</small>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <code>Too many arguments!</code></dt>
<dd><p>This message is typically printed by the &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo;
script which is in the &lsquo;<tt>contrib</tt>&rsquo; directory in the
<small>CVS</small> source distribution.  In some versions of
<small>CVS</small>, &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; has been part of the default
<small>CVS</small> installation.  The &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; script gets
called from the &lsquo;<tt>loginfo</tt>&rsquo; administrative file.
Check that the arguments passed in &lsquo;<tt>loginfo</tt>&rsquo; match
what your version of &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; expects.  In
particular, the &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; from <small>CVS</small> 1.3 and
older expects the logfile as an argument whereas the
&lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; from <small>CVS</small> 1.5 and newer expects the
logfile to be specified with a &lsquo;<samp>-f</samp>&rsquo; option.  Of
course, if you don&rsquo;t need &lsquo;<tt>log.pl</tt>&rsquo; you can just
comment it out of &lsquo;<tt>loginfo</tt>&rsquo;.

<dd><p>This message typically means that the server is not set
up properly.  For example, if &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo; points
to a nonexistent cvs executable.  To debug it further,
find the log file which inetd writes
(&lsquo;<tt>/var/log/messages</tt>&rsquo; or whatever inetd uses on
your system).  For details, see <a href="#Connection">Trouble making a connection to a CVS server</a>, and

<dd><p>This means that someone else has committed a change to
that file since the last time that you did a <code>cvs
update</code>.  So before proceeding with your <code>cvs
commit</code> you need to <code>cvs update</code>.  <small>CVS</small> will merge
the changes that you made and the changes that the
other person made.  If it does not detect any conflicts
it will report &lsquo;<samp>M <var>file</var></samp>&rsquo; and you are ready
to <code>cvs commit</code>.  If it detects conflicts it will
print a message saying so, will report &lsquo;<samp>C <var>file</var></samp>&rsquo;,

<p>This indicates a problem with the installation of

it is finding unix diff3 instead.  The exact text of

<dd><p>If <var>text</var> contains a valid response (such as
&lsquo;<samp>ok</samp>&rsquo;) followed by an extra carriage return
character (on many systems this will cause the second
part of the message to overwrite the first part), then
it probably means that you are using the &lsquo;<samp>:ext:</samp>&rsquo;
access method with a version of rsh, such as most
non-unix rsh versions, which does not by default
provide a transparent data stream.  In such cases you
probably want to try &lsquo;<samp>:server:</samp>&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<samp>:ext:</samp>&rsquo;.  If <var>text</var> is something else, this

<h2 class="appendixsec">F.2 Trouble making a connection to a CVS server</h2>

<p>This section concerns what to do if you are having
trouble making a connection to a <small>CVS</small> server.  If
you are running the <small>CVS</small> command line client
running on Windows, first upgrade the client to
<small>CVS</small> 1.9.12 or later.  The error reporting in
earlier versions provided much less information about
what the problem was.  If the client is non-Windows,
<small>CVS</small> 1.9 should be fine.
</p>
<p>If the error messages are not sufficient to track down
the problem, the next steps depend largely on which
access method you are using.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-_003aext_003a_002c-troubleshooting"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <code>:ext:</code></dt>
<dd><p>Try running the rsh program from the command line.  For
example: &quot;rsh servername cvs -v&quot; should print <small>CVS</small>
version information.  If this doesn&rsquo;t work, you need to
fix it before you can worry about <small>CVS</small> problems.
</p>
<a name="index-_003aserver_003a_002c-troubleshooting"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <code>:server:</code></dt>
<dd><p>You don&rsquo;t need a command line rsh program to use this
access method, but if you have an rsh program around,
it may be useful as a debugging tool.  Follow the
directions given for :ext:.
</p>
<a name="index-_003apserver_003a_002c-troubleshooting"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <code>:pserver:</code></dt>
<dd><p>Errors along the lines of &quot;connection refused&quot; typically indicate
that inetd isn&rsquo;t even listening for connections on port 2401
whereas errors like &quot;connection reset by peer&quot;,
&quot;received broken pipe signal&quot;, &quot;recv() from server: EOF&quot;,
or &quot;end of file from server&quot;
typically indicate that inetd is listening for
connections but is unable to start <small>CVS</small> (this is frequently
caused by having an incorrect path in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;
or by firewall software rejecting the connection).
&quot;unrecognized auth response&quot; errors are caused by a bad command
line in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;, typically an invalid option or forgetting
to put the &lsquo;<samp>pserver</samp>&rsquo; command at the end of the line.
Another less common problem is invisible control characters that
your editor &quot;helpfully&quot; added without you noticing.
</p>
<p>One good debugging tool is to &quot;telnet servername
2401&quot;.  After connecting, send any text (for example
&quot;foo&quot; followed by return).  If <small>CVS</small> is working
correctly, it will respond with
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">cvs [pserver aborted]: bad auth protocol start: foo
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>If instead you get:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">Usage: cvs [cvs-options] command [command-options-and-arguments]
...
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>then you&rsquo;re missing the &lsquo;<samp>pserver</samp>&rsquo; command at the end of the
line in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;; check to make sure that the entire command
is on one line and that it&rsquo;s complete.
</p>
<p>Likewise, if you get something like:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">Unknown command: `pserved'

CVS commands are:
        add          Add a new file/directory to the repository
...
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>then you&rsquo;ve misspelled &lsquo;<samp>pserver</samp>&rsquo; in some way.  If it isn&rsquo;t
obvious, check for invisible control characters (particularly
carriage returns) in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If it fails to work at all, then make sure inetd is working
right.  Change the invocation in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo; to run the
echo program instead of cvs.  For example:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">2401  stream  tcp  nowait  root /bin/echo echo hello
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>After making that change and instructing inetd to
re-read its configuration file, &quot;telnet servername
2401&quot; should show you the text hello and then the
server should close the connection.  If this doesn&rsquo;t
work, you need to fix it before you can worry about
<small>CVS</small> problems.
</p>
<p>On AIX systems, the system will often have its own
program trying to use port 2401.  This is AIX&rsquo;s problem
in the sense that port 2401 is registered for use with
<small>CVS</small>.  I hear that there is an AIX patch available
to address this problem.
</p>
<p>Another good debugging tool is the &lsquo;<samp>-d</samp>&rsquo;
(debugging) option to inetd.  Consult your system
documentation for more information.
</p>
<p>If you seem to be connecting but get errors like:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">cvs server: cannot open /root/.cvsignore: Permission denied
cvs [server aborted]: can't chdir(/root): Permission denied
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>then you probably haven&rsquo;t specified &lsquo;<samp>-f</samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<tt>inetd.conf</tt>&rsquo;.
(In releases prior to <small>CVS</small> 1.11.1, this problem can be caused by
your system setting the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable
for programs being run by inetd.  In this case, you can either
have inetd run a shell script that unsets <code>$HOME</code> and then runs
<small>CVS</small>, or you can use <code>env</code> to run <small>CVS</small> with a pristine
environment.)
</p>
<p>If you can connect successfully for a while but then can&rsquo;t,
you&rsquo;ve probably hit inetd&rsquo;s rate limit.
(If inetd receives too many requests for the same service
in a short period of time, it assumes that something is wrong
and temporarily disables the service.)
Check your inetd documentation to find out how to adjust the
rate limit (some versions of inetd have a single rate limit,
others allow you to set the limit for each service separately.)

<h2 class="appendixsec">F.3 Other common problems</h2>

<p>Here is a list of problems which do not fit into the
above categories.  They are in no particular order.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows, if there is a 30 second or so delay when
you run a <small>CVS</small> command, it may mean that you have
your home directory set to &lsquo;<tt>C:/</tt>&rsquo;, for example (see
<code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code> in
<a href="cvs_19.html#Environment-variables">All environment variables which affect CVS</a>).  <small>CVS</small> expects the home
directory to not end in a slash, for example &lsquo;<tt>C:</tt>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<tt>C:\cvs</tt>&rsquo;.

</li><li>
If you are running <small>CVS</small> 1.9.18 or older, and
<code>cvs update</code> finds a conflict and tries to
merge, as described in <a href="cvs_10.html#Conflicts-example">Conflicts example</a>, but
doesn&rsquo;t tell you there were conflicts, then you may
have an old version of <small>RCS</small>.  The easiest solution
probably is to upgrade to a current version of
<small>CVS</small>, which does not rely on external <small>RCS</small>
programs.
</li></ul>
