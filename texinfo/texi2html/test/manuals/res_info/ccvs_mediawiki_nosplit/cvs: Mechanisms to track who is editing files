=== Mechanisms to track who is editing files ===
<div id="index-Watches"></div>

<p>For many groups, use of <small>CVS</small> in its default mode is
perfectly satisfactory.  Users may sometimes go to
check in a modification only to find that another
modification has intervened, but they deal with it and
proceed with their check in.  Other groups prefer to be
able to know who is editing what files, so that if two
people try to edit the same file they can choose to
talk about who is doing what when rather than be
surprised at check in time.  The features in this
section allow such coordination, while retaining the
ability of two developers to edit the same file at the
same time.
</p>
<p>For maximum benefit developers should use <code>cvs
edit</code> (not <code>chmod</code>) to make files read-write to
edit them, and <code>cvs release</code> (not <code>rm</code>) to
discard a working directory which is no longer in use,
but <small>CVS</small> is not able to enforce this behavior.
