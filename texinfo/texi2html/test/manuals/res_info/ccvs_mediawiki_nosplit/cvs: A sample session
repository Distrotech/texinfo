As a way of introducing <small>CVS</small>, we&rsquo;ll go through a
typical work-session using <small>CVS</small>.  The first thing
to understand is that <small>CVS</small> stores all files in a
centralized <em>repository</em> (see [[cvs: The Repository#The Repository|Repository]]); this
section assumes that a repository is set up.

Suppose you are working on a simple compiler.  The source
consists of a handful of C files and a &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo;.
The compiler is called &lsquo;<code>tc</code>&rsquo; (Trivial Compiler),
and the repository is set up so that there is a module
called &lsquo;<code>tc</code>&rsquo;.
