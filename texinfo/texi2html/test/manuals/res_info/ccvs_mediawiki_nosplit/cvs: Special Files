In normal circumstances, <small>CVS</small> works only with regular
files.  Every file in a project is assumed to be
persistent; it must be possible to open, read and close
them; and so on.  <small>CVS</small> also ignores file permissions and
ownerships, leaving such issues to be resolved by the
developer at installation time.  In other words, it is
not possible to &quot;check in&quot; a device into a repository;
if the device file cannot be opened, <small>CVS</small> will refuse to
handle it.  Files also lose their ownerships and
permissions during repository transactions.
