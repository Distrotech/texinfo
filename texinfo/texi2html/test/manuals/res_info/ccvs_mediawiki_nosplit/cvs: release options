==== release options ====

The <code>release</code> command supports one command option:

;<code>-d</code>
: Delete your working copy of the file if the release succeeds.  If this flag is not given your files will remain in your working directory.

: '''WARNING:  The <code>release</code> command deletes all directories and files recursively.  This has the very serious side-effect that any directory that you have created inside your checked-out sources, and not added to the repository (using the <code>add</code> command; see [[cvs: Adding files to a directory#Adding files to a directory|Adding files]]) will be silently deleted&mdash;even if it is non-empty!'''
