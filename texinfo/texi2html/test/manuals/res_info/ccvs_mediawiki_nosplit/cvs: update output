==== update output ====

<p><code>update</code> and <code>checkout</code> keep you informed of
their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded
by one character indicating the status of the file:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>U <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository.  This is done for any file that exists in
the repository but not in your source, and for files
that you haven&rsquo;t changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>P <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Like &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo;, but the <small>CVS</small> server sends a patch instead of an entire
file.  This accomplishes the same thing as &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; using less bandwidth.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>A <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository
when you run <code>commit</code> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>R <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository
when you run <code>commit</code> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>M <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The file is modified in  your  working  directory.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>M</samp>&rsquo; can indicate one of two states for a file
you&rsquo;re working on: either there were no modifications
to the same file in the repository, so that your file
remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications
in the repository as well as in your copy, but they
were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
working directory.
</p>
<p><small>CVS</small> will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran <code>update</code>) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while <code>update</code> runs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>C <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><div id="index-_002e_0023-files"></div>
<div id="index-_005f_005f-files-_0028VMS_0029"></div>
<p>A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to <var>file</var> with changes from the source
repository.  <var>file</var> (the copy in your working
directory) is now the result of attempting to merge
the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
&lsquo;<tt>.#<var>file</var>.<var>revision</var></tt>&rsquo; where <var>revision</var>
is the revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
[cvs: Conflicts example#Conflicts-example Conflicts example].
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with &lsquo;<tt>.#</tt>&rsquo; if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under <small>VMS</small>, the file name starts with
&lsquo;<tt>__</tt>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<tt>.#</tt>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>? <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p><var>file</var> is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for <small>CVS</small> to ignore (see the
description of the &lsquo;<samp>-I</samp>&rsquo; option, and
see [cvs: Ignoring files via cvsignore#cvsignore cvsignore]).
