==== update output ====

<code>update</code> and <code>checkout</code> keep you informed of
their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded
by one character indicating the status of the file:

;<code>U <var>file</var></code>
: The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.  This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not in your source, and for files that you haven&rsquo;t changed but are not the most recent versions available in the repository.

;<code>P <var>file</var></code>
: Like &lsquo;<code>U</code>&rsquo;, but the <small>CVS</small> server sends a patch instead of an entire file.  This accomplishes the same thing as &lsquo;<code>U</code>&rsquo; using less bandwidth.

;<code>A <var>file</var></code>
: The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, and will be added to the source repository when you run <code>commit</code> on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

;<code>R <var>file</var></code>
: The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources, and will be removed from the source repository when you run <code>commit</code> on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

;<code>M <var>file</var></code>
: The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

: &lsquo;<code>M</code>&rsquo; can indicate one of two states for a file you&rsquo;re working on: either there were no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your working directory.

: <small>CVS</small> will print some messages if it merges your work, and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked before you ran <code>update</code>) will be made.  The exact name of that file is printed while <code>update</code> runs.

;<code>C <var>file</var></code>
<div id="index-_002e_0023-files"></div>
<div id="index-_005f_005f-files-_0028VMS_0029"></div>
: A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to <var>file</var> with changes from the source repository.  <var>file</var> (the copy in your working directory) is now the result of attempting to merge the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your working directory, with the name &lsquo;<tt>.#<var>file</var>.<var>revision</var></tt>&rsquo; where <var>revision</var> is the revision that your modified file started from.  Resolve the conflict as described in [[cvs: Conflicts example#Conflicts example|Conflicts example]]. (Note that some systems automatically purge files that begin with &lsquo;<tt>.#</tt>&rsquo; if they have not been accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)  Under <small>VMS</small>, the file name starts with &lsquo;<tt>__</tt>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<tt>.#</tt>&rsquo;.

;<code>? <var>file</var></code>
: <var>file</var> is in your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files for <small>CVS</small> to ignore (see the description of the &lsquo;<code>-I</code>&rsquo; option, and see [[cvs: Ignoring files via cvsignore#Ignoring files via cvsignore|cvsignore]]).
