Some file permission issues are specific to Windows
operating systems (Windows 95, Windows NT, and
presumably future operating systems in this family.
Some of the following might apply to OS/2 but I&rsquo;m not
sure).

If you are using local <small>CVS</small> and the repository is on a
networked file system which is served by the Samba SMB
server, some people have reported problems with
permissions.  Enabling WRITE=YES in the samba
configuration is said to fix/workaround it.
Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t investigated enough to know the
implications of enabling that option, nor do I know
whether there is something which <small>CVS</small> could be doing
differently in order to avoid the problem.  If you find
something out, please let us know as described in
[[cvs: Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual#Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual|BUGS]].
