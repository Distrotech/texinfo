=== Other common problems ===

<p>Here is a list of problems which do not fit into the
above categories.  They are in no particular order.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows, if there is a 30 second or so delay when
you run a <small>CVS</small> command, it may mean that you have
your home directory set to &lsquo;<tt>C:/</tt>&rsquo;, for example (see
<code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code> in
[cvs: All environment variables which affect CVS#Environment-variables Environment variables]).  <small>CVS</small> expects the home
directory to not end in a slash, for example &lsquo;<tt>C:</tt>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<tt>C:\cvs</tt>&rsquo;.

</li><li>
If you are running <small>CVS</small> 1.9.18 or older, and
<code>cvs update</code> finds a conflict and tries to
merge, as described in [cvs: Conflicts example#Conflicts-example Conflicts example], but
doesn&rsquo;t tell you there were conflicts, then you may
have an old version of <small>RCS</small>.  The easiest solution
probably is to upgrade to a current version of
<small>CVS</small>, which does not rely on external <small>RCS</small>
programs.
</li></ul>
