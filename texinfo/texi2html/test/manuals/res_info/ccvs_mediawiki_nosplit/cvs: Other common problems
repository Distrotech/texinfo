=== Other common problems ===

Here is a list of problems which do not fit into the
above categories.  They are in no particular order.


* On Windows, if there is a 30 second or so delay when you run a <small>CVS</small> command, it may mean that you have your home directory set to &lsquo;<tt>C:/</tt>&rsquo;, for example (see <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code> in [[cvs: All environment variables which affect CVS#All environment variables which affect CVS|Environment variables]]).  <small>CVS</small> expects the home directory to not end in a slash, for example &lsquo;<tt>C:</tt>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<tt>C:\cvs</tt>&rsquo;.


* If you are running <small>CVS</small> 1.9.18 or older, and <code>cvs update</code> finds a conflict and tries to merge, as described in [[cvs: Conflicts example#Conflicts example|Conflicts example]], but doesn&rsquo;t tell you there were conflicts, then you may have an old version of <small>RCS</small>.  The easiest solution probably is to upgrade to a current version of <small>CVS</small>, which does not rely on external <small>RCS</small> programs.
