=== Merging differences between any two revisions ===

<div id="index-Revisions_002c-merging-differences-between"></div>
<div id="index-Differences_002c-merging"></div>

<p>With two &lsquo;<samp>-j <var>revision</var></samp>&rsquo; flags, the <code>update</code>
(and <code>checkout</code>) command can merge the differences
between any two revisions into your working file.
</p>
<div id="index-Undoing-a-change"></div>
<div id="index-Removing-a-change"></div>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs update -j 1.5 -j 1.3 backend.c
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>will undo all changes made between revision
1.3 and 1.5.  Note the order of the revisions!
</p>
<p>If you try to use this option when operating on
multiple files, remember that the numeric revisions will
probably be very different between the various files.
You almost always use symbolic
tags rather than revision numbers when operating on
multiple files.

<p>Specifying two &lsquo;<samp>-j</samp>&rsquo; options can also undo file
removals or additions.  For example, suppose you have
a file
named &lsquo;<tt>file1</tt>&rsquo; which existed as revision 1.1, and
you then removed it (thus adding a dead revision 1.2).
Now suppose you want to add it again, with the same
contents it had previously.  Here is how to do it:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs update -j 1.2 -j 1.1 file1
U file1
$ cvs commit -m test
Checking in file1;
/tmp/cvs-sanity/cvsroot/first-dir/file1,v  &lt;--  file1
new revision: 1.3; previous revision: 1.2
done
$
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>
