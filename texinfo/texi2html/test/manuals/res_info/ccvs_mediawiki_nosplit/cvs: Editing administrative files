<p>You edit the administrative files in the same way that you would edit
any other module.  Use &lsquo;<samp>cvs checkout CVSROOT</samp>&rsquo; to get a working
copy, edit it, and commit your changes in the normal way.
</p>
<p>It is possible to commit an erroneous administrative
file.  You can often fix the error and check in a new
revision, but sometimes a particularly bad error in the
administrative file makes it impossible to commit new
revisions.
