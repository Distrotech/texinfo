<p>A file can have several versions, as described above.
Likewise, a software product can have several versions.
A software product is often given a version number such
as &lsquo;<samp>4.1.1</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Versions in the first sense are called <em>revisions</em>
in this document, and versions in the second sense are
called <em>releases</em>.  To avoid confusion, the word
<em>version</em> is almost never used in this document.
