=== Updating with the import command ===

<p>When a new release of the source arrives, you import it into the
repository with the same <code>import</code> command that you used to set up
the repository in the first place.  The only difference is that you
specify a different release tag this time:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ tar xfz wdiff-0.05.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.05
$ cvs import -m &quot;Import of FSF v. 0.05&quot; fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_05
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>For files that have not been modified locally, the newly created
revision becomes the head revision.  If you have made local
changes, <code>import</code> will warn you that you must merge the changes
into the main trunk, and tell you to use &lsquo;<samp>checkout -j</samp>&rsquo; to do so:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs checkout -jFSF_DIST:yesterday -jFSF_DIST wdiff
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>The above command will check out the latest revision of
&lsquo;<samp>wdiff</samp>&rsquo;, merging the changes made on the vendor branch &lsquo;<samp>FSF_DIST</samp>&rsquo;
since yesterday into the working copy.  If any conflicts arise during
the merge they should be resolved in the normal way (see section [cvs: Conflicts example#Conflicts-example Conflicts example]).  Then, the modified files may be committed.
</p>
<p>However, it is much better to use the two release tags rather than using
a date on the branch as suggested above:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs checkout -jWDIFF_0_04 -jWDIFF_0_05 wdiff
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>The reason this is better is that
using a date, as suggested above, assumes that you do
not import more than one release of a product per day.
More importantly, using the release tags allows <small>CVS</small> to detect files
that were removed between the two vendor releases and mark them for
removal.  Since <code>import</code> has no way to detect removed files, you
should do a merge like this even if <code>import</code> doesn&rsquo;t tell you to.
