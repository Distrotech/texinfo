There are certain file names that frequently occur
inside your working copy, but that you don&rsquo;t want to
put under <small>CVS</small> control.  Examples are all the object
files that you get while you compile your sources.
Normally, when you run &lsquo;<code>cvs update</code>&rsquo;, it prints a
line for each file it encounters that it doesn&rsquo;t know
about (see [[cvs: update output#update output|update output]]).

<small>CVS</small> has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns)
that it should ignore while running <code>update</code>,
<code>import</code> and <code>release</code>.
This list is constructed in the following way.


* The list is initialized to include certain file name patterns: names associated with <small>CVS</small> administration, or with other common source control systems; common names for patch files, object files, archive files, and editor backup files; and other names that are usually artifacts of assorted utilities. Currently, the default list of ignored file name patterns is:

<div id="index-Ignored-files"></div>
<div id="index-Automatically-ignored-files"></div>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
     RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
     RCSLOG  cvslog.*
     tags    TAGS
     .make.state     .nse_depinfo
     *~      #*      .#*     ,*      _$*     *$
     *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
     *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
     *.Z     *.elc   *.ln
     core
</div>
</td></tr></table>


* The per-repository list in &lsquo;<tt>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; is appended to the list, if that file exists.


* The per-user list in &lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; in your home directory is appended to the list, if it exists.


* Any entries in the environment variable <code>$CVSIGNORE</code> is appended to the list.


* Any &lsquo;<code>-I</code>&rsquo; options given to <small>CVS</small> is appended.


* As <small>CVS</small> traverses through your directories, the contents of any &lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; will be appended to the list. The patterns found in &lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; are only valid for the directory that contains them, not for any sub-directories.

In any of the 5 places listed above, a single
exclamation mark (&lsquo;<code>!</code>&rsquo;) clears the ignore list.
This can be used if you want to store any file which
normally is ignored by <small>CVS</small>.

Specifying &lsquo;<code>-I !</code>&rsquo; to <code>cvs import</code> will import
everything, which is generally what you want to do if
you are importing files from a pristine distribution or
any other source which is known to not contain any
extraneous files.  However, looking at the rules above
you will see there is a fly in the ointment; if the
distribution contains any &lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; files, then
the patterns from those files will be processed even if
&lsquo;<code>-I !</code>&rsquo; is specified.  The only workaround is to
remove the &lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; files in order to do the
import.  Because this is awkward, in the future
&lsquo;<code>-I !</code>&rsquo; might be modified to override
&lsquo;<tt>.cvsignore</tt>&rsquo; files in each directory.

Note that the syntax of the ignore files consists of a
series of lines, each of which contains a space
separated list of filenames.  This offers no clean way
to specify filenames which contain spaces, but you can
use a workaround like &lsquo;<tt>foo?bar</tt>&rsquo; to match a file
named &lsquo;<tt>foo bar</tt>&rsquo; (it also matches &lsquo;<tt>fooxbar</tt>&rsquo;
and the like).  Also note that there is currently no
way to specify comments.
