<p><small>CVS</small> is a version control system.  Using it, you can
record the history of your source files.
</p>

<p>For example, bugs sometimes creep in when
software is modified, and you might not detect the bug
until a long time after you make the modification.
With <small>CVS</small>, you can easily retrieve old versions to see
exactly which change caused the bug.  This can
sometimes be a big help.
</p>
<p>You could of course save every version of every file
you have ever created.  This would
however waste an enormous amount of disk space.  <small>CVS</small>
stores all the versions of a file in a single file in a
clever way that only stores the differences between
versions.
</p>
<p><small>CVS</small> also helps you if you are part of a group of people working
on the same project.  It is all too easy to overwrite
each others&rsquo; changes unless you are extremely careful.
Some editors, like <small>GNU</small> Emacs, try to make sure that
the same file is never modified by two people at the
same time.  Unfortunately, if someone is using another
editor, that safeguard will not work.  <small>CVS</small> solves this problem
by insulating the different developers from each other.  Every
developer works in his own directory, and <small>CVS</small> merges
the work when each developer is done.

<p><small>CVS</small> started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by
Dick Grune, posted to the newsgroup
<code>comp.sources.unix</code> in the volume 6
release of July, 1986.  While no actual code from
these shell scripts is present in the current version
of <small>CVS</small> much of the <small>CVS</small> conflict resolution algorithms
come from them.
</p>
<p>In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded <small>CVS</small>.
Jeff Polk later helped Brian with the design of the <small>CVS</small>
module and vendor branch support.

free download from the internet.  For more information

<div id="index-Newsgroups"></div>
<p>There is a mailing list, known as <code>info-cvs</code>,
devoted to <small>CVS</small>.  To subscribe or
unsubscribe
write to
<code>info-cvs-request@gnu.org</code>.
If you prefer a usenet group, the right
group is <code>comp.software.config-mgmt</code> which is for
<small>CVS</small> discussions (along with other configuration
management systems).  In the future, it might be
possible to create a
<code>comp.software.config-mgmt.cvs</code>, but probably only
if there is sufficient <small>CVS</small> traffic on
<code>comp.software.config-mgmt</code>.
</p>
<p>You can also subscribe to the <code>bug-cvs</code> mailing list,
described in more detail in [cvs: Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual#BUGS BUGS].  To subscribe
send mail to <code>bug-cvs-request@gnu.org</code>.
