==== Creating Files From Other Version Control Systems ====
<div id="index-Importing-files_002c-from-other-version-control-systems"></div>

<p>If you have a project which you are maintaining with
another version control system, such as <small>RCS</small>, you
may wish to put the files from that project into
<small>CVS</small>, and preserve the revision history of the
files.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><div id="index-RCS_002c-importing-files-from"></div>
</dd>
<dt>From RCS</dt>
<dd><p>If you have been using <small>RCS</small>, find the <small>RCS</small>
files&mdash;usually a file named &lsquo;<tt>foo.c</tt>&rsquo; will have its
<small>RCS</small> file in &lsquo;<tt>RCS/foo.c,v</tt>&rsquo; (but it could be
other places; consult the <small>RCS</small> documentation for
details).  Then create the appropriate directories in
<small>CVS</small> if they do not already exist.  Then copy the
files into the appropriate directories in the <small>CVS</small>
repository (the name in the repository must be the name
of the source file with &lsquo;<samp>,v</samp>&rsquo; added; the files go
directly in the appropriate directory of the repository,
not in an &lsquo;<tt>RCS</tt>&rsquo; subdirectory).  This is one of the
few times when it is a good idea to access the <small>CVS</small>
repository directly, rather than using <small>CVS</small>
commands.  Then you are ready to check out a new
working directory.
</p>
<p>The <small>RCS</small> file should not be locked when you move it
into <small>CVS</small>; if it is, <small>CVS</small> will have trouble
letting you operate on it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>From another version control system</dt>
<dd><p>Many version control systems have the ability to export
<small>RCS</small> files in the standard format.  If yours does,
export the <small>RCS</small> files and then follow the above
instructions.
</p>
<p>Failing that, probably your best bet is to write a
script that will check out the files one revision at a
time using the command line interface to the other
system, and then check the revisions into <small>CVS</small>.
The &lsquo;<tt>sccs2rcs</tt>&rsquo; script mentioned below may be a
useful example to follow.
</p>
<div id="index-SCCS_002c-importing-files-from"></div>
</dd>
<dt>From SCCS</dt>
<dd><p>There is a script in the &lsquo;<tt>contrib</tt>&rsquo; directory of
the <small>CVS</small> source distribution called &lsquo;<tt>sccs2rcs</tt>&rsquo;
which converts <small>SCCS</small> files to <small>RCS</small> files.
Note: you must run it on a machine which has both
<small>SCCS</small> and <small>RCS</small> installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).
</p>
<div id="index-PVCS_002c-importing-files-from"></div>
</dd>
<dt>From PVCS</dt>
<dd><p>There is a script in the &lsquo;<tt>contrib</tt>&rsquo; directory of
the <small>CVS</small> source distribution called &lsquo;<tt>pvcs_to_rcs</tt>&rsquo;
which converts <small>PVCS</small> archives to <small>RCS</small> files.
You must run it on a machine which has both
<small>PVCS</small> and <small>RCS</small> installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).  See the comments in the script for details.
