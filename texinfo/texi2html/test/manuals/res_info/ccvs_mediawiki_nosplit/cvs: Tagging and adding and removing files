=== Tagging and adding and removing files ===

<p>The subject of exactly how tagging interacts with
adding and removing files is somewhat obscure; for the
most part <small>CVS</small> will keep track of whether files
exist or not without too much fussing.  By default,
tags are applied to only files which have a revision
corresponding to what is being tagged.  Files which did
not exist yet, or which were already removed, simply
omit the tag, and <small>CVS</small> knows to treat the absence
of a tag as meaning that the file didn&rsquo;t exist as of
that tag.
</p>
<p>However, this can lose a small amount of information.
For example, suppose a file was added and then removed.
Then, if the tag is missing for that file, there is no
way to know whether the tag refers to the time before
the file was added, or the time after it was removed.
If you specify the &lsquo;<samp>-r</samp>&rsquo; option to <code>cvs rtag</code>,
then <small>CVS</small> tags the files which have been removed,
and thereby avoids this problem.  For example, one
might specify <code>-r HEAD</code> to tag the head.
</p>
<p>On the subject of adding and removing files, the
<code>cvs rtag</code> command has a &lsquo;<samp>-a</samp>&rsquo; option which
means to clear the tag from removed files that would
not otherwise be tagged.  For example, one might
specify this option in conjunction with &lsquo;<samp>-F</samp>&rsquo; when
moving a tag.  If one moved a tag without &lsquo;<samp>-a</samp>&rsquo;,
then the tag in the removed files might still refer to
the old revision, rather than reflecting the fact that
the file had been removed.  I don&rsquo;t think this is
necessary if &lsquo;<samp>-r</samp>&rsquo; is specified, as noted above.
