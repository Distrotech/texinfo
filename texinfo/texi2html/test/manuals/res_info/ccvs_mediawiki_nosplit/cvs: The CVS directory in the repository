==== The CVS directory in the repository ====
<div id="index-CVS-directory_002c-in-repository"></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<tt>CVS</tt>&rsquo; directory in each repository directory
contains information such as file attributes (in a file
called &lsquo;<tt>CVS/fileattr</tt>&rsquo;.  In the
future additional files may be added to this directory,
so implementations should silently ignore additional
files.
</p>
<p>This behavior is implemented only by <small>CVS</small> 1.7 and
later; for details see [[cvs: Using watches with old versions of CVS#Using watches with old versions of CVS|Watches Compatibility]].
</p>
<p>The format of the fileattr file is a series of entries
of the following form (where &lsquo;<samp>{</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>}</samp>&rsquo;
means the text between the braces can be repeated zero
or more times):
</p>
<p><var>ent-type</var> <var>filename</var> &lt;tab&gt; <var>attrname</var> = <var>attrval</var>
  {; <var>attrname</var> = <var>attrval</var>} &lt;linefeed&gt;
</p>
<p><var>ent-type</var> is &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; for a file, in which case the entry specifies the
attributes for that file.
</p>
<p><var>ent-type</var> is &lsquo;<samp>D</samp>&rsquo;,
and <var>filename</var> empty, to specify default attributes
to be used for newly added files.
</p>
<p>Other <var>ent-type</var> are reserved for future expansion.  <small>CVS</small> 1.9 and older
will delete them any time it writes file attributes.
<small>CVS</small> 1.10 and later will preserve them.
</p>
<p>Note that the order of the lines is not significant;
a program writing the fileattr file may
rearrange them at its convenience.
</p>
<p>There is currently no way of quoting tabs or linefeeds in the
filename, &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; in <var>attrname</var>,
&lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo; in <var>attrval</var>, etc.  Note: some implementations also
don&rsquo;t handle a NUL character in any of the fields, but
implementations are encouraged to allow it.
</p>
<p>By convention, <var>attrname</var> starting with &lsquo;<samp>_</samp>&rsquo; is for an attribute given
special meaning by <small>CVS</small>; other <var>attrname</var>s are for user-defined attributes
(or will be, once implementations start supporting user-defined attributes).
</p>
<p>Builtin attributes:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>_watched</code></dt>
<dd><p>Present means the file is watched and should be checked out
read-only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>_watchers</code></dt>
<dd><p>Users with watches for this file.  Value is
<var>watcher</var> &gt; <var>type</var> { , <var>watcher</var> &gt; <var>type</var> }
where <var>watcher</var> is a username, and <var>type</var>
is zero or more of edit,unedit,commit separated by
&lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; (that is, nothing if none; there is no &quot;none&quot; or &quot;all&quot; keyword).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>_editors</code></dt>
<dd><p>Users editing this file.  Value is
<var>editor</var> &gt; <var>val</var> { , <var>editor</var> &gt; <var>val</var> }
where <var>editor</var> is a username, and <var>val</var> is
<var>time</var>+<var>hostname</var>+<var>pathname</var>, where
<var>time</var> is when the <code>cvs edit</code> command (or
equivalent) happened,
and <var>hostname</var> and <var>pathname</var> are for the working directory.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Example:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>Ffile1 _watched=;_watchers=joe&gt;edit,mary&gt;commit
Ffile2 _watched=;_editors=sue&gt;8 Jan 1975+workstn1+/home/sue/cvs
D _watched=
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>means that the file &lsquo;<tt>file1</tt>&rsquo; should be checked out
read-only.  Furthermore, joe is watching for edits and
mary is watching for commits.  The file &lsquo;<tt>file2</tt>&rsquo;
should be checked out read-only; sue started editing it
on 8 Jan 1975 in the directory &lsquo;<tt>/home/sue/cvs</tt>&rsquo; on
the machine <code>workstn1</code>.  Future files which are
added should be checked out read-only.  To represent
this example here, we have shown a space after
&lsquo;<samp>D</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Ffile1</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>Ffile2</samp>&rsquo;, but in fact
there must be a single tab character there and no spaces.
