== Adding, removing, and renaming files and directories ==

<p>In the course of a project, one will often add new
files.  Likewise with removing or renaming, or with
directories.  The general concept to keep in mind in
all these cases is that instead of making an
irreversible change you want <small>CVS</small> to record the
fact that a change has taken place, just as with
modifying an existing file.  The exact mechanisms to do
this in <small>CVS</small> vary depending on the situation.
