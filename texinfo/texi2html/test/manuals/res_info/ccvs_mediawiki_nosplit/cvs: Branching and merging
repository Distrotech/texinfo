<small>CVS</small> allows you to isolate changes onto a separate
line of development, known as a <em>branch</em>.  When you
change files on a branch, those changes do not appear
on the main trunk or other branches.

Later you can move changes from one branch to another
branch (or the main trunk) by <em>merging</em>.  Merging
involves first running <code>cvs update -j</code>, to merge
the changes into the working directory.
You can then commit that revision, and thus effectively
copy the changes onto another branch.
