=== Overall structure of CVS commands ===
<div id="index-Structure"></div>
<div id="index-CVS-command-structure"></div>
<div id="index-Command-structure"></div>
<div id="index-Format-of-CVS-commands"></div>

<p>The overall format of all <small>CVS</small> commands is:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>cvs</code></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the <small>CVS</small> program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cvs_options</code></dt>
<dd><p>Some options that affect all sub-commands of <small>CVS</small>.  These are
described below.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cvs_command</code></dt>
<dd><p>One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit &lsquo;<samp>cvs_command</samp>&rsquo;: &lsquo;<samp>cvs -H</samp>&rsquo; elicits a
list of available commands, and &lsquo;<samp>cvs -v</samp>&rsquo; displays version
information on <small>CVS</small> itself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>command_options</code></dt>
<dd><p>Options that are specific for the command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>command_args</code></dt>
<dd><p>Arguments to the commands.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>There is unfortunately some confusion between
<code>cvs_options</code> and <code>command_options</code>.
&lsquo;<samp>-l</samp>&rsquo;, when given as a <code>cvs_option</code>, only
affects some of the commands.  When it is given as a
<code>command_option</code> is has a different meaning, and
is accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.
