=== Temporary directories for the server ===
<div id="index-Temporary-directories_002c-and-server"></div>
<div id="index-Server_002c-temporary-directories"></div>

<p>While running, the <small>CVS</small> server creates temporary
directories.  They are named
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 cvs-serv<var>pid</var>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>where <var>pid</var> is the process identification number of
the server.
They are located in the directory specified by 
the &lsquo;<samp>-T</samp>&rsquo; global option (see [[cvs: Global options#Global options|Global options]]), 
the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable (see [[cvs: All environment variables which affect CVS#All environment variables which affect CVS|Environment variables]]), 
or, failing that, &lsquo;<tt>/tmp</tt>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>In most cases the server will remove the temporary
directory when it is done, whether it finishes normally
or abnormally.  However, there are a few cases in which
the server does not or cannot remove the temporary
directory, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the server aborts due to an internal server error,
it may preserve the directory to aid in debugging

</li><li>
If the server is killed in a way that it has no way of
cleaning up (most notably, &lsquo;<samp>kill -KILL</samp>&rsquo; on unix).

</li><li>
If the system shuts down without an orderly shutdown,
which tells the server to clean up.
</li></ul>

<p>In cases such as this, you will need to manually remove
the &lsquo;<tt>cvs-serv<var>pid</var></tt>&rsquo; directories.  As long as
there is no server running with process identification
number <var>pid</var>, it is safe to do so.
