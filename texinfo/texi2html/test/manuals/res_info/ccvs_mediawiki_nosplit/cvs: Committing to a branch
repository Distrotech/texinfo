===== Committing to a branch =====

<p>You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the &lsquo;<samp>-r</samp>&rsquo; option.  To
create a branch revision, use the &lsquo;<samp>-b</samp>&rsquo; option
of the <code>rtag</code> or <code>tag</code> commands
(see section [cvs: Branching and merging#Branching-and-merging Branching and merging]).  Then, either <code>checkout</code> or
<code>update</code> can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
<code>commit</code> changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cd product_module
[[ hack away ]]
$ cvs commit
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>This works automatically since the &lsquo;<samp>-r</samp>&rsquo; option is
sticky.
