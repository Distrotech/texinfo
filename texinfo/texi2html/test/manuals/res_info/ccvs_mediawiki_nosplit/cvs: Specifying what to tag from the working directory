=== Specifying what to tag from the working directory ===

<div id="index-tag-_0028subcommand_0029"></div>
<p>The example in the previous section demonstrates one of
the most common ways to choose which revisions to tag.
Namely, running the <code>cvs tag</code> command without
arguments causes <small>CVS</small> to select the revisions which
are checked out in the current working directory.  For
example, if the copy of &lsquo;<tt>backend.c</tt>&rsquo; in working
directory was checked out from revision 1.4, then
<small>CVS</small> will tag revision 1.4.  Note that the tag is
applied immediately to revision 1.4 in the repository;
tagging is not like modifying a file, or other
operations in which one first modifies the working
directory and then runs <code>cvs commit</code> to transfer
that modification to the repository.
</p>
<p>One potentially surprising aspect of the fact that
<code>cvs tag</code> operates on the repository is that you
are tagging the checked-in revisions, which may differ
from locally modified files in your working directory.
If you want to avoid doing this by mistake, specify the
&lsquo;<samp>-c</samp>&rsquo; option to <code>cvs tag</code>.  If there are any
locally modified files, <small>CVS</small> will abort with an
error before it tags any files:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs tag -c rel-0-4
cvs tag: backend.c is locally modified
cvs [tag aborted]: correct the above errors first!
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>
