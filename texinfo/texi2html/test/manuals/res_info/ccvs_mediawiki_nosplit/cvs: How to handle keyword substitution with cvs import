=== How to handle keyword substitution with cvs import ===

<p>The sources which you are importing may contain
keywords (see [cvs: Keyword substitution#Keyword-substitution Keyword substitution]).  For example,
the vendor may use <small>CVS</small> or some other system
which uses similar keyword expansion syntax.  If you
just import the files in the default fashion, then
the keyword expansions supplied by the vendor will
be replaced by keyword expansions supplied by your
own copy of <small>CVS</small>.  It may be more convenient to
maintain the expansions supplied by the vendor, so
that this information can supply information about
the sources that you imported from the vendor.
</p>
<p>To maintain the keyword expansions supplied by the
vendor, supply the &lsquo;<samp>-ko</samp>&rsquo; option to <code>cvs
import</code> the first time you import the file.
This will turn off keyword expansion
for that file entirely, so if you want to be more
selective you&rsquo;ll have to think about what you want
and use the &lsquo;<samp>-k</samp>&rsquo; option to <code>cvs update</code> or
<code>cvs admin</code> as appropriate.
