Roland Pesch, then of Cygnus Support &lt;<tt>roland@wrs.com</tt>&gt;
wrote the manual pages which were distributed with
<small>CVS</small> 1.3.  Much of their text was copied into this
manual.  He also read an early draft
of this manual and contributed many ideas and
corrections.

The mailing-list <code>info-cvs</code> is sometimes
informative. I have included information from postings
made by the following persons:
David G. Grubbs &lt;<tt>dgg@think.com</tt>&gt;.

Some text has been extracted from the man pages for
<small>RCS</small>.

The <small>CVS</small> <small>FAQ</small> by David G. Grubbs has provided
useful material.  The <small>FAQ</small> is no longer maintained,
however, and this manual is about the closest thing there
is to a successor (with respect to documenting how to
use <small>CVS</small>, at least).

In addition, the following persons have helped by
telling me about mistakes I&rsquo;ve made:

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="display" style="font-family: serif">

The list of contributors here is not comprehensive; for a more
complete list of who has contributed to this manual see

distribution.
