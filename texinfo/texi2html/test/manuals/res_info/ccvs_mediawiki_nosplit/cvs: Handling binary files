<p>The most common use for <small>CVS</small> is to store text
files.  With text files, <small>CVS</small> can merge revisions,
display the differences between revisions in a
human-visible fashion, and other such operations.
However, if you are willing to give up a few of these
abilities, <small>CVS</small> can store binary files.  For
example, one might store a web site in <small>CVS</small>
including both text files and binary images.
