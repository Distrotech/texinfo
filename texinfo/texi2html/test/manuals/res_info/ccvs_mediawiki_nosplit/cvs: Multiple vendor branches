=== Multiple vendor branches ===

<p>All the examples so far assume that there is only one
vendor from which you are getting sources.  In some
situations you might get sources from a variety of
places.  For example, suppose that you are dealing with
a project where many different people and teams are
modifying the software.  There are a variety of ways to
handle this, but in some cases you have a bunch of
source trees lying around and what you want to do more
than anything else is just to all put them in <small>CVS</small> so
that you at least have them in one place.
</p>
<p>For handling situations in which there may be more than
one vendor, you may specify the &lsquo;<samp>-b</samp>&rsquo; option to
<code>cvs import</code>.  It takes as an argument the vendor
branch to import to.  The default is &lsquo;<samp>-b 1.1.1</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that there are two teams, the red
team and the blue team, that are sending you sources.
You want to import the red team&rsquo;s efforts to branch
1.1.1 and use the vendor tag RED.  You want to import
the blue team&rsquo;s efforts to branch 1.1.3 and use the
vendor tag BLUE.  So the commands you might use are:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs import dir RED RED_1-0
$ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir BLUE BLUE_1-5
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Note that if your vendor tag does not match your
&lsquo;<samp>-b</samp>&rsquo; option, <small>CVS</small> will not detect this case!  For
example,
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir RED RED_1-0
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Be careful; this kind of mismatch is sure to sow
confusion or worse.  I can&rsquo;t think of a useful purpose
for the ability to specify a mismatch here, but if you
discover such a use, don&rsquo;t.  <small>CVS</small> is likely to make this
an error in some future release.
