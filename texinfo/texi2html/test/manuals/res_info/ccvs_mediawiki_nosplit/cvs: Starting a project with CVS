<p>Because renaming files and moving them between
directories is somewhat inconvenient, the first thing
you do when you start a new project should be to think
through your file organization.  It is not impossible
to rename or move files, but it does increase the
potential for confusion and <small>CVS</small> does have some
quirks particularly in the area of renaming
directories.  See [cvs: Moving and renaming files#Moving-files Moving files].

<p>What to do next depends on the situation at hand.
