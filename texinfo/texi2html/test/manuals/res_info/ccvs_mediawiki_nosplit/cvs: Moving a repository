=== Moving a repository ===

Just as backing up the files in the repository is
pretty much like backing up any other files, if you
need to move a repository from one place to another it
is also pretty much like just moving any other
collection of files.

The main thing to consider is that working directories
point to the repository.  The simplest way to deal with
a moved repository is to just get a fresh working
directory after the move.  Of course, you&rsquo;ll want to
make sure that the old working directory had been
checked in before the move, or you figured out some
other way to make sure that you don&rsquo;t lose any
changes.  If you really do want to reuse the existing
working directory, it should be possible with manual
surgery on the &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Repository</tt>&rsquo; files.  You can
see [[cvs: How data is stored in the working directory#How data is stored in the working directory|Working directory storage]], for information on
the &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Repository</tt>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<tt>CVS/Root</tt>&rsquo; files, but
unless you are sure you want to bother, it probably
isn&rsquo;t worth it.
