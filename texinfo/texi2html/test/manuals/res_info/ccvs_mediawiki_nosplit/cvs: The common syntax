The administrative files such as &lsquo;<tt>commitinfo</tt>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<tt>loginfo</tt>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<tt>rcsinfo</tt>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<tt>verifymsg</tt>&rsquo;, etc.,
all have a common format.  The purpose of the files are
described later on.  The common syntax is described
here.

<div id="index-Regular-expression-syntax"></div>
Each line contains the following:

* A regular expression.  This is a basic regular expression in the syntax used by GNU emacs.


* A whitespace separator&mdash;one or more spaces and/or tabs.


* A file name or command-line template.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the
character &lsquo;<code>#</code>&rsquo; are treated as comments.  Long lines
unfortunately can ''not'' be broken in two parts in
any way.

The first regular expression that matches the current
directory name in the repository is used.  The rest of the line
is used as a file name or command-line as appropriate.
