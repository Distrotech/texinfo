==== Commitinfo ====
<div id="index-commitinfo"></div>
<div id="index-Commits_002c-precommit-verification-of"></div>
<div id="index-Precommit-checking"></div>

The &lsquo;<tt>commitinfo</tt>&rsquo; file defines programs to execute
whenever &lsquo;<code>cvs commit</code>&rsquo; is about to execute.  These
programs are used for pre-commit checking to verify
that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for
instance, to verify that the changed files conform to
to your site&rsquo;s standards for coding practice.

As mentioned earlier, each line in the
&lsquo;<tt>commitinfo</tt>&rsquo; file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template can include
a program name and any number of arguments you wish to
supply to it.  The full path to the current source
repository is appended to the template, followed by the
file names of any files involved in the commit (added,
removed, and modified files).

<div id="index-Exit-status_002c-of-commitinfo"></div>
The first line with a regular expression matching the
directory within the repository will be used.  If the
command returns a non-zero exit status the commit will
be aborted.

<div id="index-DEFAULT-in-commitinfo"></div>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the &lsquo;<code>DEFAULT</code>&rsquo;
line is used, if it is specified.

<div id="index-ALL-in-commitinfo"></div>
All occurrences of the name &lsquo;<code>ALL</code>&rsquo; appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or the name &lsquo;<code>DEFAULT</code>&rsquo;.

<div id="index-commitinfo_002c-working-directory"></div>
<div id="index-commitinfo_002c-command-environment"></div>
The command will be run in the root of the workspace
containing the new versions of any files the user would like
to modify (commit), ''or in a copy of the workspace on
the server (see [[cvs: Remote repositories#Remote repositories|Remote repositories]])''.  If a file is
being removed, there will be no copy of the file under the
current directory.  If a file is being added, there will be
no corresponding archive file in the repository unless the
file is being resurrected.

Note that both the repository directory and the corresponding
Attic (see [[cvs: The attic#The attic|Attic]]) directory may need to be checked to
locate the archive file corresponding to any given file being
committed.  Much of the information about the specific commit
request being made, including the destination branch, commit
message, and command line options specified, is not available
to the command.
