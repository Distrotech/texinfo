good grasp on what <small>CVS</small> can do for you.  This
chapter talks a little about things that you still have
to decide.
</p>
<p>If you are doing development on your own using <small>CVS</small>
you could probably skip this chapter.  The questions
this chapter takes up become more important when more
than one person is working in a repository.
