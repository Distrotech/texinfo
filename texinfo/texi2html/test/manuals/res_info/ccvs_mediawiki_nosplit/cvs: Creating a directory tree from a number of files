==== Creating a directory tree from a number of files ====
<div id="index-Importing-files"></div>

<p>When you begin using <small>CVS</small>, you will probably already have several
projects that can be
put under <small>CVS</small> control.  In these cases the easiest way is to use the
<code>import</code> command.  An example is probably the easiest way to
explain how to use it.  If the files you want to install in
<small>CVS</small> reside in &lsquo;<tt><var>wdir</var></tt>&rsquo;, and you want them to appear in the
repository as &lsquo;<tt>$CVSROOT/yoyodyne/<var>rdir</var></tt>&rsquo;, you can do this:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cd <var>wdir</var>
$ cvs import -m &quot;Imported sources&quot; yoyodyne/<var>rdir</var> yoyo start
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Unless you supply a log message with the &lsquo;<samp>-m</samp>&rsquo;
flag, <small>CVS</small> starts an editor and prompts for a
message.  The string &lsquo;<samp>yoyo</samp>&rsquo; is a <em>vendor tag</em>,
and &lsquo;<samp>start</samp>&rsquo; is a <em>release tag</em>.  They may fill
no purpose in this context, but since <small>CVS</small> requires
them they must be present.  See section [cvs: Tracking third-party sources#Tracking-sources Tracking third-party sources], for
more information about them.
</p>
<p>You can now verify that it worked, and remove your
original source directory.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"><nowiki>$ cd ..
$ cvs checkout yoyodyne/<var>rdir</var>       # <span class="roman">Explanation below</span>
$ diff -r <var>wdir</var> yoyodyne/<var>rdir</var>
$ rm -r <var>wdir</var>
</nowiki></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Erasing the original sources is a good idea, to make sure that you do
not accidentally edit them in <var>wdir</var>, bypassing <small>CVS</small>.
Of course, it would be wise to make sure that you have
a backup of the sources before you remove them.
</p>
<p>The <code>checkout</code> command can either take a module
name as argument (as it has done in all previous
examples) or a path name relative to <code>$CVSROOT</code>,
as it did in the example above.
</p>
<p>It is a good idea to check that the permissions
<small>CVS</small> sets on the directories inside <code>$CVSROOT</code>
are reasonable, and that they belong to the proper
groups.  See section [cvs: File permissions#File-permissions File permissions].
</p>
<p>If some of the files you want to import are binary, you
may want to use the wrappers features to specify which
files are binary and which are not.  See section [cvs: The cvswrappers file#Wrappers The cvswrappers file].
