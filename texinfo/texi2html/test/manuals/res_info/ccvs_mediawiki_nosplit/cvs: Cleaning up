Before you turn to other tasks you decide to remove your working copy of
tc.  One acceptable way to do that is of course

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 $ cd ..
 $ rm -r tc
</div>
</td></tr></table>

but a better way is to use the <code>release</code> command (see [[cvs: release--Indicate that a Module is no longer in use#release&mdash;Indicate that a Module is no longer in use|release]]):

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div class="example">
 $ cd ..
 $ cvs release -d tc
 M driver.c
 ? tc
 You have <nowiki>[</nowiki>1<nowiki>]</nowiki> altered files in this repository.
 Are you sure you want to release (and delete) directory `tc': n
 ** `release' aborted by user choice.
</div>
</td></tr></table>

The <code>release</code> command checks that all your modifications have been
committed.  If history logging is enabled it also makes a note in the
history file.  See [[cvs: The history file#The history file|history file]].

When you use the &lsquo;<code>-d</code>&rsquo; flag with <code>release</code>, it
also removes your working copy.

In the example above, the <code>release</code> command wrote a couple of lines
of output.  &lsquo;<code>? tc</code>&rsquo; means that the file &lsquo;<tt>tc</tt>&rsquo; is unknown to <small>CVS</small>.
That is nothing to worry about: &lsquo;<tt>tc</tt>&rsquo; is the executable compiler,
and it should not be stored in the repository.  See [[cvs: Ignoring files via cvsignore#Ignoring files via cvsignore|cvsignore]],
for information about how to make that warning go away.
See [[cvs: release output#release output|release output]], for a complete explanation of
all possible output from <code>release</code>.

&lsquo;<code>M driver.c</code>&rsquo; is more serious.  It means that the
file &lsquo;<tt>driver.c</tt>&rsquo; has been modified since it was
checked out.

The <code>release</code> command always finishes by telling
you how many modified files you have in your working
copy of the sources, and then asks you for confirmation
before deleting any files or making any note in the
history file.

You decide to play it safe and answer <code>n &lt;RET&gt;</code>
when <code>release</code> asks for confirmation.
