* Synopsis: diff <nowiki>[</nowiki>-lR<nowiki>]</nowiki> <nowiki>[</nowiki>-k kflag<nowiki>]</nowiki> <nowiki>[</nowiki>format_options<nowiki>]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[</nowiki>-r rev1 | -D date1<nowiki>]</nowiki> <nowiki>[</nowiki>-r rev2 |  -D date2<nowiki>]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[</nowiki>files&hellip;<nowiki>]</nowiki>

* Requires: working directory, repository.

* Changes: nothing.

The <code>diff</code> command is used to compare different
revisions of files.  The default action is to compare
your working files with the revisions they were based
on, and report any differences that are found.

If any file names are given, only those files are
compared.  If any directories are given, all files
under them will be compared.

The exit status for diff is different than for other
<small>CVS</small> commands; for details [[cvs: CVS's exit status#CVS&rsquo;s exit status|Exit status]].
