Use the <code>import</code> command to check in the sources
for the first time.  When you use the <code>import</code>
command to track third-party sources, the <em>vendor
tag</em> and <em>release tags</em> are useful.  The
<em>vendor tag</em> is a symbolic name for the branch
(which is always 1.1.1, unless you use the &lsquo;<code>-b
<var>branch</var></code>&rsquo; flag&mdash;see [[cvs: Multiple vendor branches#Multiple vendor branches|Multiple vendor branches]].).  The
<em>release tags</em> are symbolic names for a particular
release, such as &lsquo;<code>FSF_0_04</code>&rsquo;.

Note that <code>import</code> does ''not'' change the
directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it
does not set up that directory as a <small>CVS</small> working
directory; if you want to work with the sources import
them first and then check them out into a different
directory (see [[cvs: Getting the source#Getting the source|Getting the source]]).

<div id="index-wdiff-_0028import-example_0029"></div>
Suppose you have the sources to a program called
<code>wdiff</code> in a directory &lsquo;<tt>wdiff-0.04</tt>&rsquo;,
and are going to make private modifications that you
want to be able to use even when new releases are made
in the future.  You start by importing the source to
your repository:

<div class="example" style="margin-left: 3.2em">
 $ cd wdiff-0.04
 $ cvs import -m &quot;Import of FSF v. 0.04&quot; fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_04
</div>

The vendor tag is named &lsquo;<code>FSF_DIST</code>&rsquo; in the above
example, and the only release tag assigned is
&lsquo;<code>WDIFF_0_04</code>&rsquo;.
