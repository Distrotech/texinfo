== Compatibility between CVS Versions ==

The repository format is compatible going back to
<small>CVS</small> 1.3.  But see [[cvs: Multiple developers#Using watches with old versions of CVS|Watches Compatibility]], if
you have copies of <small>CVS</small> 1.6 or older and you want
to use the optional developer communication features.

The working directory format is compatible going back
to <small>CVS</small> 1.5.  It did change between <small>CVS</small> 1.3
and <small>CVS</small> 1.5.  If you run <small>CVS</small> 1.5 or newer on
a working directory checked out with <small>CVS</small> 1.3,
<small>CVS</small> will convert it, but to go back to <small>CVS</small>
1.3 you need to check out a new working directory with
<small>CVS</small> 1.3.

The remote protocol is interoperable going back to <small>CVS</small> 1.5, but no
further (1.5 was the first official release with the remote protocol,
but some older versions might still be floating around).  In many
cases you need to upgrade both the client and the server to take
advantage of new features and bugfixes, however.
