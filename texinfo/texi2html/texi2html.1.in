.SH NAME
texi2html \- a Texinfo to HTML converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texi2html [options] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Texi2html
converts the given Texinfo file to a set of HTML files. It tries to handle
most of the Texinfo commands. It creates hypertext links for cross-references,
footnotes...
.PP
It also tries to add links from a reference to its corresponding entry in the
bibliography (if any). It may also handle a glossary (see the
.B \-glossary
option).
.PP
.I Texi2html
may furthermore use latex2html to generate HTML (code and/or images) for @math
and @iftex tags (see the 
.B \-l2h
option).
.PP
.I Texi2html
creates several files depending on the contents of the Texinfo file and on
the chosen options (see FILES).
.PP
The HTML files created by
.I texi2html
are closer to TeX than to Info.
.SH OPTIONS
Options may be abbreviated to th shortests unique prefix. The
following is only an incomplete list of the available options: 
.TP 12
.B \-help [1|2]
Print usage instructions and list the most important, all relevant,
or all recognised (including obsolete) command-line options, and exit. 
.TP
.B \-expand info|tex|none
Expand @ifinfo, or @iftex, or sections (default: info)
.TP
.B \-glossary
Use the section named 'Glossary' to build a list of terms and put links in the HTML
document from each term toward its definition.
.TP
.B \-I \fIdir\fP
Look also in \fIdir\fP to find included files.
.TP
.B \-menu
Show the Texinfo menus; by default they are ignored.
.TP
.B \-number
Number the sections.
.TP
.B \-split chapter|section
Split the output into several HTML files (one per main chapter/section).
.TP
.B \-l2h
Use latex2html for content of @math and @tex tags. Content must be such that 
both, latex and tex, can translate it correctly. I.e., no tex-only constructs 
must be used.
.TP
.B \-l2h_l2h \fIprog\fP  
Use \fIprog\fP as latex2html program (default \fIlatex2html\fP). 
Program must be executable. 
.TP
.B \-l2h_init \fIfile\fP  
Use \fIfile\fP as latex2html init file. \fIfile\fP should be used to specify in which way latex2html handles mathematical expressions and formulas. 

Note that latex2html locates  
(and uses) init-files in the following order (provided they exist): 
(1) global init file (usually in latex2html source dir) 
(2) $HOME/.latex2html_init 
(3) ./.latex2html_init 
(4) init file given on command line.  
.TP
.B \-l2h_tmp \fIdir\fP
Use \fIdir\fP as tmp dir for latex2html. This directory (resp. its path) 
must not contain a dot  (i.e., a ".").
.TP 
.B \-l2h_clean
remove all intermediate files generated by latex2html (prevents caching!)  
.TP 
.B \-l2h_skip
Do not really run latex2html. Use (kept) files of previous runs, instead.
.TP
.B \-Verbose
Give a verbose output. 
.TP
.B \-version
Print version and exit.
.PP
.SH FILES
Initialisation options are read first from @sysconfdir@/texi2htmlrc
(the exact location being changeable with the
.RI --sysconfdir= dir
option to the configure script), then from $HOME/.texi2htmlrc,
then any command-line options including -init_file options;
with later settings overriding earlier ones.
.P
By default
.I texi2html
creates the following files (foo being the name of the Texinfo file):
.TP 16
.B foo_toc.html
The table of contents.
.TP
.B foo.html
The document's contents.
.TP
.B foo_foot.html
The footnotes (if any).
.TP
.B foo_l2h_img*
Images generated by latex2html (if any).
.PP
When used with the
.B \-split
option, it creates several files (one per chapter or node), named
.B foo_n.html
(n being the index of the chapter or node), instead of the single
.B foo.html
file.
.PP
Otherwise it creates only one file:
.B foo.html
.SH VERSION
This is \fItexi2html\fP version @T2H_VERSION@, @T2H_DATE@.

.SH BUGS
This man-page is not up-to-date and there exists no up-to-date documentation, yet.
Until it exists, see the beginning of the texi2html.init file for remarks about
command-line options and configurations.
.PP
A row of a  mutlicolumn table has to be in one line.
.PP
The generated HTML output is syntactically pretty bad.
.PP
TeX specific commands (normally enclosed in @iftex) will be
passed over unmodified, unless latex2html is enabled.
