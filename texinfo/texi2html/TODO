This file contains a list of things yet to be done (see also in doc/IDEAS):

* Create detailed texinfo documentation (see in doc)

* add sample init files for different layouts
  - use events (onmousover, etc) for anchors
  - use style-sheets for formatting of various elements (like @example,
  etc).
  - xhtml with in line style
  - Singular manual style

* bring deftypemethod, etc up-to-date

* Change installation procedure so that init files of the distribution 
  can be loaded in at run-time

* Fix `make distcheck'
