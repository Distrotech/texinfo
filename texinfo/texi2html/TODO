This file conatins a list of things yet to be done (most
important first):

* Create detailed texinfo documentation

* fix duplicate section entries when using unnumbered sections

* use events (onmousover, etc) for anchors

* use style-sheets for formatting of various elements (like @example,
  etc).

* add sample init files for different layouts

* split on @section

* bring deftypemethod, etc up-to-date

* Change installation procedure so that init files of the distribution 
  can be loaded in at run-time
