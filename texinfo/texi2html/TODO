This file contains a list of things yet to be done (see also in doc/TODO):

* Create detailed texinfo documentation (see in doc)

* add sample init files for different layouts
  - use events (onmousover, etc) for anchors
  - use style-sheets for formatting of various elements (like @example,
  etc).
  - xhtml with in line style
  - Singular manual style
  - How complicated could it be to get a creation of XML, what about SGML ?
  - to LaTeX
  - to RTF

* document css classes, and have similar classes with makeinfo
-  makeinfo classes:
ul menu, 
ul index-cp index-*, 
div node (navigation bar), 

- texi2html classes:
table index-cp index-*, 
table menu, 
h3 node
ul toc,

- same classes:
pre verbatim, 
pre example display...,
table cartouche, 
small dots, small enddots, 
div contents shortcontents, div footnote, 
h? unnumbered chapter appendix...,
h1 settitle (title before contents, if not set by titlefont),
h1 titlefont (@titlefont),

* use <link> for navigation, maybe wait before this is done in makeinfo
(see http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.12 and
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.3.3)

* Document Texi2HTML::THIS_ELEMENT

* Document $NEW_CROSSREF_STYLE, $EXTERNAL_CROSSREF_SPLIT,
  $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'htmlxref'}
  $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'current_lang'}
  $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{macro name}
  $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'hyphenation'}

* Test the back path stuff for images.

* don't double in title when the @top and @settitle are the same

* handle right things like
-> error with @item on same line than @table
@xref{node,
@table @emph
@item line
text
@end table
}

@code{
@printindex cp
}

* maybe some @-commands appearing on lines should stop paragraphs, namely
@page or @indent. That's not sure. More likely this should be up to the 
writer to add a line.

* handle better things like
@itemize @bullet
@cindex example
@item
In the example
@end itemize

* @macro definition in @ifset is parsed but ignored. So in the following, the
@end ifset appearing in the macro is ignored, and the macro isn't defined.
Don't know if it's right.

@ifset a
@macro bidule
@end ifset
@end macro
@end ifset

* @m_cedilla appears in output with --macro-expand. That's a bug.

* in chm.init (Jose Fonseca)

[WINDOWS]
 
Default=,"ug.hhc","ug.hhk","ug.html","ug.html",,,,,0x22520,,0x384e,,,,,,,,0

The numbers are a bitmask of the enabled buttons. The ones here are
IMO a good default. In the future you may also add that as an
option, as the Docbook XSL stylesheets do (see in
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/snapshot/doc/html/rn20.html
all the CHM related parameters one can change).

* BUG?: @special in multitable extracted but ignored later.
The real fix would be to give to multitable each header within brace 
texi and formatted result. And also give the fractions and maybe use them.

* handling of images should be more configurable for other formats.

* add f--ile to the repository, and do a test in another directory for
  test of missing files.

* many FIXME in the code

* test @printindex in diverse contexts

* in index_split the section associated with indices is the numbered section
  not the associated node where the @cindex are. Good or bad?

* document the 'math' in 'args', in style_map, and simple_*math*. It
  could also be more flexible and similar with other environments, that
  is not only add a fixed key, but duplicate all the keys and add one.
  Documentation should only done once the interface is stable.

* roff is certainly not uptodate. At least the @quote* and @guillem*

* ducument $documentdescription and $copying_comment. enhance titlepage
  handling

* test @anchor, @*index and @footnote in titlepage. Fix footnote handling
  in special regions.

* maybe be quiet during specail region expansion outside of document. It
  is not very clear that it is wrong, though.
