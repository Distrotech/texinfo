	* doc/Makefile.in: Added missing doc/Makefile.in since its absence
	  caused 'configure' and make targets (such as 'distclean') to bomb.

2000-09-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* applied patches/fixes from  Eric Marsden <emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr>.
	  o DTD now at the beginning of the document
	  o default language to 'en' wasn't working which led to empty LANG=""
	    in <BODY>
	  o missing </FONT> in footer blurb
	  o when the ToC was generated in some cases, the code used
	    <UL></UL> to indent, but didn't have any <LI> tags.  <blockquote>
	    is now used in such cases, instead.

2000-09-11  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle nested braces ('{' and '}') at
	  all, thus valid macro invocations such as
	  "@mymacro{Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}.}" would fail.
	  Prior to this fix, @mymacro would be handed the argument
	  "Hello @emph{there", which is clearly incorrect.  Now @mymacro
	  correctly receives "Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}." as its
	  argument.  This fix also deals properly with the protected brace
	  sequences \{, \}, @{, and @}.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle arguments split over multiple lines,
	  such as "@mymacro{Hello \n world.}".  Now it correctly handles
	  macro invocations split across any number of lines, and properly
	  flags an error at the correct location if the user forgets the
	  closing brace '}'.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed formatting errors in expansions of @SPACE,
	  @TAB, and @NL (where SPACE, TAB, and NL represent the actual
	  space, tab, and newline characters).  The Texinfo manual
	  explicitly states that each of these sequences should expand to a
	  "printable" space in the [rendered] output.  The example given in
	  the manual shows that "Spacey@ @ @ @ example" should expand to
	  "Spacey    example".  However, texi2html was only emitting the
	  insignificant whitespace ' ' and '\n' into the HTML output which
	  did not properly preserve the hard spaces in "Spacey    example".
	  Now each of these directives expands to '&nbsp;' instead.

	* texi2html.pl: Made aesthetic improvement to the output of @file{},
	  @option{}, and @samp{}.  The argument string is now quoted with
	  ` and ' _after_ the style has been applied.  For instance,
	  @samp{perl} now expands to "`<samp>perl</samp>'", whereas it used
	  to expand to "<samp>`perl'</samp>".  In my tests, this change
	  results in more aesthetically pleasing rendered output on various
	  browsers.

2000-08-16  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Bug fix from: "joseph" <joseph@freenet.de>
	MySimple.pm should be 'require'd, but checked is still texi2html.init.

2000-08-14  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * new command line switch (Test purposes only!)
          to show new layout in HTML for @def stuff.
        * Texinfo-Documentation updated.
          - New chapter about ``customizing HTML'' started.
          - multiple files instead of one.
          - subdirectory doc.

2000-07-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed Getopt::Long::Configure("pass_through") for
	older versions of Getopt::Long which do not support his function.

2000-07-11  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* implemented @documentlanguage:
	  - sets language of document, unless overwritten by -lang, or 
	    explicitely set $T2H_LANG

	* introduced T2H_OBSOLETE_OPTIONS to prevent obsolete options to 
	  ambiguate current options
	
2000-07-09  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * Texinfo-Documentation:
          - fixes from Peter Moulder <pjm@bofh.asn.au> incorporated
            into manual.
          - Updated Manual
            o improved
            o indices for options, variables of script.
            o much more.
        * texi2html.init:
          - improvements for different languages
            (month names, words in different languages).

	though) 
	* Distribution: Incorporated texi2html.texi authored by Karl Heinz
	Marbaise <khmarbaise@gmx.de> (THANKS!)
	
	* texi2html.1.in: Updates to reflect new cmd-line options

	* Rewrote handling of command-line options:
	- based on (My)Simple.pm, and Getopt::Long
	-help now works and is up-to-date
	-help 1 lists also "not-so-important" options
	-help 2 lists also obsolete options
	- the following options were renamed: (old options still work, but 
	  are marked as obsolete)
	    verbose            ==> Verbose
	    section_navigation ==> sec_nav
	    output_file        ==> out_file
	- the following options are obsoleted (still work, though):
 	    no-section_navigation ==> -nosec_nav
	    use_acc		  ==> ALWAYS use accents
	    expandinfo		  ==> -expand info	
	    expandtex		  ==> -expand tex
	    no_verbose            ==> default case
	    monolithic            ==> default case
	    split_node            ==> -split section
	    split_chapter         ==> -split chapter
	
2000-06-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Fixed bug in anchor generation (reported by various people who
	noticed that @anchor may not be on one line with @item)
	* Fixed infinite loop on missing '@end macro'
	* texi2html.pl: -expandinfo and -expandtex command-line options
	for backward compatibility

	* texi2html.init: Use ISO 639 language codes for keys in $T2H_LANG 
	hash.

2000-06-26  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: new command-line options:
	 -nonumber, -nomenu to unset the default -number -menu

	* texi2html.pl: As suggested by "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>:
	insert <A NAME="#nodename"></A> for each
	nodename in a document (nodename is exactly as in texinfo
	source). 
	
	* From: "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>
	  o $T2H_FRAMES internal boolean variable which defaults to 0
	  o -frames command line option which changes $T2H_FRAMES to 1.
	  o If $T2H_FRAMES is 1, then two additional files are output.
	    If mydoc.html is output normally, then mydoc_frame.html
	    and mydoc_frame_toc.html files are output.
	  o The functions T2H_print_frame, and T2H_print_toc_frame are used to
		generate contents of these files.
	  o The T2H_DEFAULT_print_frame and T2H_DEFAULT_print_toc_frame
	    (defined in texi2html.ini) do the following:
       mydoc_frame.html is the short file with <FRAME> tags.
       mydoc_frame_toc.html is basically the short table of contents
       which goes on the narrow left frame.
	
	* texi2html.pl: @,{c} --> &ccedil;

2000-06-23  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	    o handle \} in macro arguments
	* from brlewis@alum.mit.edu:
	    o Changes to facilitate CSS
	    o -toc_file option for those who want the TOC to be index.html
	    o Config variable $T2H_HREF_DIR_INSTEAD_FILE:
	       if set (e.g., to index.html) replace hrefs to this file 
               (i.e., to index.html) by ./
	* texi2html.pl: index generation after value substitution

2000-05-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: for def_map stuff <A NAME=..> before output
	* texi2html.pl: applied patch from "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@ap.com>
	                for @refs with 2 or 3 args: use 3rd or 2nd argor
			section (in that order) as text for reference.

	argument.

2000-04-08  Peter Moulder  <pjm@bofh.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Generate texi2html in

	* texi2html.pl: $docu_top=$T2H_TOP_FILE || $docu_name. $docu_ext;

2000-03-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: $complex_format_map for complex enclosing
	constructs where which: 
	* texi2html.init:$T2H_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL,
	$T2H_SMALL_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL, $T2H_SMALL_FONT_SIZE for
	customizing indent/font size of block-enclosing texinfo command
	(@example, @format, @display, etc).
	* Release version 1.61.

2000-03-29  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Cleaned up texi2html.pl and added loading of init file (when
	texi2html.pl is run) such that it can directly be used as script
	(otherwise, debugging is much harder).

	* fixed getpwuid 

	* Added T2H_print_chapter_header, T2H_print_chapter_footer for
	more fine-grained control of T2H_SPLIT eq 'chapter', added option
	-section_navigation, $T2H_SECTION_NAVIGATION to suppress output of
	navigation panels per section

	* Changed naming and and calling convention of customizable subs:
	They all have prefix T2H_, are called with &$T2H_, are assigned by 
	$T2H_<name> = \&T2H_DEFAULT_<name>.

	* texi2html.init: Incorporated changed of Peter Moulder:
	
2000-03-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* debian/*: deleted
	* texi2html.pl: Incorporated changes of Peter Moulder
	* texi2html.pl: Automatic node pointer creation added
	* texi2html.pl: @enddots, @exclamdown, etc added

2000-03-26  Peter Moulder  <reiter@netspace.net.au>

	* texi2html.init: Address a couple of weblint/tidy warnings.

	* texi2html.init:
	* texi2html.pl: The init file is inserted into the executable at
	build time (see Makefile.am).

	* texi2html.pl: Source each of @sysconfdir@/texi2htmlrc and
	$HOME/.texi2htmlrc if it exists, after processing texi2html.init
	but before anything on the command-line.
	
	Allow -split_chapter, -split_node, -monolithic options, which is
	what previous versions of texi2html used.
	
	Support `@command{...}'.
	
	Add --help, --version options.
	
	-sidx isn't used, so comment out.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.am:
	* autogen.sh: New files.

	* configure.in: Change version number from 1.60Beta to 1.59.2.

	* debian/*: New files.

	* texi2html.1.in:
	* texi2html.pl: Extract the man page into a separate file.  At the
	moment, the man page is even installed separately (with
	texi2html.pl having `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' in place of the
	manpage).  Conceivably we could add a configure option to
	construct everything as one file like we used to; just replace
	that text with `@EMBEDDED_MANPAGE@', which would be replaced with
	either the existing `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' or with texi2html.1
	contents the way texi2html.init is done.
	
2000-03-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: center @image by default, can be overwritten by
	T2H_CENTER_IMAGE (sunshine@sunshineco.com)
