- What about the idea to put user-based configuration into
  directory ".texi2html"
- System-Wide configuration into directory "/etc/texi2html"

- The rule for loading confguration should be:
   /etc/texi2html/...     <--- System-Wide configuration.
   $HOME/.texi2htmlrc     <--- User base config file
   $HOME/.texi2html/      <--- more complex configuration files

- The rule for loading language depend files:
  /etc/texi2html/texi2html.en  <--- System wide lang. config.
  $HOME/.texi2html/texi2html.de <--- User lang config files.

- How complicated could it be to get a creation of XML instead
  of HTML? Or what about XHTML or SGML ?
