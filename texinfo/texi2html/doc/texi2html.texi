@node Overview
@chapter Overview about @command{texi2html}
@uref{http://www.texinfo.org,Texinfo} is the official
documentation format of the @uref{http://www.gnu.org,GNU}
project. It uses a single source file to produce both
online information and printed output.

@c much thinking about ...
It is often proposed to have a way to produce
@acronym{HTML} from Texinfo sources, like the GNU-Info
format. It is much simpler to create one converter instead
of writing all documentation new in @acronym{HTML}, cause
there is so much documentation in Texinfo all over
the world.

Some time ago @command{makeinfo} wasn't able to produce
@acronym{HTML} output format, but there were needs to have
@acronym{HTML}. This was the borning hour for
@command{texi2html}. The basic purpose of @file{texi2html}
is to convert Texinfo documents into @acronym{HTML}.

* HowToGetHTML::       Ways to get HTML files.
* whytexi2html::       Why texi2html and not makeinfo?.

@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node HowToGetHTML
@section Ways to get HTML
You would like to @acronym{HTML} files out of your Texinfo
files? There exist two ways which you can go.
This first is to use @command{makeinfo} itself to produce
@acronym{HTML} output. The second is to use
@command{texi2html}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node whytexi2html
@section Why @file{texi2html} and not @file{makeinfo}?
The basic idea of @command{makeinfo}'s @acronym{HTML}
output was to get a readable @acronym{HTML} output.
Nothing sophisticated.
@c nor good styling just readable.

The current development of texi2html is going into
different direction.

The main purpose is to get better styling, better design
etc. of the created @acronym{HTML} pages. This way is
supported using differnt command line options and of course
possible changings of the initialization file to fit your
own needs.

@c The main disadvantage of @acronym{makeinfo}'s
@c @acronym{HTML} output is your getting only one big file.
@c This is of course readable but not very usable. The problem
@c of this is, while you like to have splitted chapters or
@c nodes the Texinfo source has to be read at minimum twice
@c times. This makes it impossible to implement this in
@c @command{makeinfo}. This would result in complete new
@c implementation of @command{makeinfo}'s source.

@c think more about this????
In contrast to the @acronym{HTML} produced by @command{makeinfo
--html} (the @command{makeinfo} program is part of the
Texinfo distribution), the @acronym{HTML} output of @file{texi2html}
is highly configurable. Among other differences, 
@command{texi2html} allows you to customize the entire
page layout (like headers, footers, style sheets, etc)
and the low level @acronym{HTML} formatting, to 
split documents at various levels, and to use
@command{latex2html} to convert @code{@@tex} sections.

@command{texi2html} should reasonably convert all Texinfo
4.6 constructs. If not, please send a bug report to
@c @email{texi2html@@mathematik.uni-kl.de}.
@email{users@@texi2html.cvshome.org}.

@c ========================================================
@node Installation
@chapter Installation of @command{texi2html}
@cindex Installation

To run @command{texi2html} you need @command{perl} version 
5.004 or above. The current version has not been tested
extensively on versions below 5.6, however.

@command{texi2html} is a standard Automake-based distribution.
If you have a source version, you should run @command{./configure}
to regenerate the script file @file{texi2html}. This leads to
the inclusion in @file{texi2html.pl} of @file{MySimple.pm} which 
handles the command line options, @file{texi2html.init} the 
default configuration file and @file{T2h_i18n} used for 
internationalisation.

To make the documentation run @command{make}.
 
Installing @command{texi2html} in you path should be sufficient 
to run it. In case you want to use a configuration file for
@command{latex2html} when using @command{latex2html} to 
convert @code{@@tex} sections, or you want to have some
default configuration files you should install these files 
in a suitable directory (usually @file{/usr/share/texi2html} or
@file{/usr/local/share/texi2html}). @command{make install} will
do that for you.
