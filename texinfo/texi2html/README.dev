Customizing texi2html
=====================

Initialisation options are read first from
'/usr/local/etc/texi2html/Config' (the exact location being changeable with
the '--sysconfdir=dir' option to the configure script), then from
$HOME/.texi2html/Config, then any command-line options including --init-file
options; with later settings overriding earlier ones.

The default initialisation options are defined in the
'texi2html.pm' and built-in formats files in formats/*.pm files 
contained in the Texi2html distribution (in fact, a script pastes 
those files into the beginning of the perl file generated by 
`./configure' from texi2html.pl and generates the actual 'texi2html' 
script this way.).

To customize 'texi2html' it is best if you copy the appropriate
sections from the 'texi2html.pm' file into an appropriate local
initialization file, make the necessary changes there, and then have
'texi2html' read this initialisation file by one of the means described
above.


Documentation of texi2html
==========================

The texi2html Texinfo manual is lagging behind the development. In 
addition, you might want to have a look at the comments in the 
'texi2html.pm' file for explanations about customizable parameters 
and at the (not up-to-date) texi2html man page for an overview of 
texi2html's synopsis.

Texi2html source files:

    texi2html                   Actual script to run. Generated by
                                make, `buildt2h.sh' and `addformats.sh' 
                                from texi2html.pl, texi2html.pm, 
                                MySimple.pm, T2h_i18n.pm, examples/l2h.init, 
                                translations.pl and formats/*.pm.

    texi2html.pl                Main source file of the converter.

    texi2html_configured.pl     File generated by `./configure' from
                                texi2html.pl.

    texi2html.pm                Default values of configurable
                                parameters. `buildt2h.sh' inserts this
                                file into texi2html_configured.pl when 
                                it generates the actual `texi2html' script.

    MySimple.pm                 Perl module which handles the
                                processing of command-line options. 
                                `buildt2h.sh' inserts this file into
                                texi2html_configured.pl when it generates 
                                the actual `texi2html' script.

    T2h_i18n.pm                 Code used to handle strings
                                internationalization (obsolete).

    translations.pl             translations of strings generated by
                                the script `manage_i18n.pl' from source
                                files and files in the `i18n' directory
                                (obsolete).

    po_document/                Directory containing po files used for
                                translation of strings. The primary source
                                for the file are outside of texi2html,
                                in the texinfo po_document/ directory.

    po_messages/                Directory containing po files used for
                                translation of strings. The primary source
                                for the file are outside of texi2html,
                                in the texinfo po/ directory.

    i18n/                       Directory containing one file per language
                                with translation of strings (obsolete,
                                generated from po_document/ files).

Helper scripts

    gettext_to_separated.pl     Helper scripts used to convert gettext po
    separated_to_hash.pl        files to the former format used by texi2html

                                from the source files and the files in the
                                `i18n/' directory.

    buildt2h.sh                 Helper script used to regenerate the texi2html
                                script. A simple wrapper around a sed 
                                one-liner.
