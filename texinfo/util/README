All the files here are maintained as part of the Texinfo distribution

These scripts actually get installed:
  texindex texi2dvi texi2pdf pdftexi2dvi
  (along with *.bat on Windows)
  Also the XML stuff: texinfo.dtd texinfo.cat.

These are examples of wrapping makeinfo invocation to achieve their
various jobs:
  detexinfo texi-elements-by-size texi2html
  txicmdlist txicustomvars txixml2texi
