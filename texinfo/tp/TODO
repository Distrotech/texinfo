In a first step, close when the the command to be closed is at the 
top of the tree, not when it should be closed theoretically.
Then it could be possible to come back to the place where the command
should be closed and give an error message.

Karl idea to keep the information on the exact location of the @mymacro:
(pertusus had the same idea).
here's a crazy idea that just popped into my head: what if we kept track
of column numbers as well as line numbers?  Then whether the macro was
involved would be a matter of checking if the column number was < or >
the place where the error occurred.

Spaces are now kept with the command args.  This is bad in most
cases.  They should be taken out as special content.

test invalid, especially commands not closed/bad nesting
test root_commands, like nodes and sections
Test for @columnfractions in a random place and something like
@multitable aaa @columnfractions 0.3 0.7

parse @sp a bit more.
