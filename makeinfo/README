makeinfo is a standalone program to convert Texinfo source into Info
files readable with standalone info or M-x info in Emacs.

makeinfo can also output other formats: plain ASCII (with --no-headers)
or HTML (with --html) or XML (with --xml).

The Emacs function M-x texinfo-format-buffer does more or less the same
job, but makeinfo is faster and gives better error messages.

As of Texinfo 5.0, this C implementation of makeinfo has been replaced
by a Perl implementation; see ../tp.
