This is an experimental program intended to replicate the functionality 
in tp/Parser.pm.  How it will be integrated into makeinfo is still 
unknown.

makeinfo in this directory wraps texi2any-C.pl, which is tp/texi2any.pl 
changed to use the module in the Parsetexi subdirectory instead of 
Texinfo::Parser.  At the current state of development it has not 
successfully processed any Texinfo input file.
