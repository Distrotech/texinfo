* Add a way to serialize labels_information, indices_information, etc., 
to ease testing that the produced parse tree is what the backends 
require.

* Convert makeinfo backends to use a Perl stub for the C API. The C parser 
will not be used at this point.

* Substitute the XS API implementation for the Perl API when the C parser is 
good enough.

Other tasks -
* implement node name normalization output converter
