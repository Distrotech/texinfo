* Add a way to serialize extra keys, indices_information, etc.  This will 
allow integration with makeinfo, "hello world", which will then greatly 
ease testing that the produced parse tree is what the backends require.

* Convert makeinfo backends to use a Perl stub for the C API. The C parser 
will not be used at this point.

* Substitute the XS API implementation for the Perl API when the C parser is 
good enough.
