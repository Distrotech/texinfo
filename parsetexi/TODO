* Implement code passing error messages and warnings to the Perl code.
* @set/@value
* @verb
* Counters for e.g. numbers of arguments read so far for a brace 
command, or the row in a table.
* Implement parser options
* Character encoding issues - read and pass to Perl correctly.

Integration with rest of Perl code:

Passing data as Perl code to be evaluated in very slow, which limits the 
speed-up that is obtained. One way round this would be to access the 
parse tree in the Perl code through an API. This would be done in two 
stages:

* Convert makeinfo backends to use a Perl stub for the C API. The C 
parser will not be used at this point.
* Substitute the XS API implementation for the Perl API when the C 
parser is good enough.
