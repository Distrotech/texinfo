Most test files use a testing infrastructure from t/test_utils.pl.

In that case the reference output files for the test of a test category 
$test_category.t file are in t/results/$test_category/.  For example, if 
after running "make check" test-suite.log contains a line like:

FAIL: t/03coverage_braces.t 324 - test_image converted html

you can see the difference between the expected and actual output with

  diff t/results/coverage_braces/test_image.pl{,.new}

To review all the differences for one of the *.t test files, you can do:

  for f in t/results/coverage_braces/*.pl; do echo --------; echo \
  Differences in $f; diff $f{,.new}; done | less

The reference files are regenerated with the -g option given to the .t 
file, as in

  perl -w t/03coverage_braces.t -g

To regenerate a specific test reference file, the test name should be 
given as an argument.  For example, to just regenerate the reference 
files for the "test_image" test within t/03.coverage_braces.t, run

  perl -w t/03coverage_braces.t -g test_image

From the top directory, you can also create texinfo files corresponding with
tests by running something along

  perl -w t/60macro.t -c

to create a file for each of the test in t/60macro.t, or for a specific
test, here arg_body_expansion_order: 

  perl -w t/60macro.t -c arg_body_expansion_order


The output files will be created with -o, in t/output_files/$test_category/
